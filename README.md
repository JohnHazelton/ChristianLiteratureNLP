# Christian Literature NLP
Data Science project using NLP to explore the changes in Christian literature over the centuries.


Here, I explored the works of six different prominent Christian authors (2 works per author). These works spanned 6 centuries, starting with John Calvin from the 1500's, extending to more current works by John Piper from the early 2000's. The twelve works are stored in .txt file format, and can be found in the "corpus" folder. The analysis includes exploration of term frequencies, word embeddings, and topic modelling (utlizing PCA & LDA). Findings can be found in the PDF report.

In the "data-organization" notebook, I loaded and parsed the text files, and structured the words into various tables such as VOCAB, TOKEN, TFIDF, etc. that could then be used for analysis. I stored these tables in csv files and worked off of them in my "analysis" notebook.
