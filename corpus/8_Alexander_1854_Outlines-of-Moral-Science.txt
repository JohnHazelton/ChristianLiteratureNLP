PREFACE.

   THE work now offered to the public is the last which proceeded from the
   lamented author's hand. In the days which immediately preceded his
   peaceful departure out of the present life, and while his powers were
   free from all clouds and weakness, he spoke of these papers as nearly
   prepared for the press, and consigned them with that intention to two
   of his sons. With a trifling exception, the whole had been carefully
   transcribed by the hand of filial duty from his own character, which,
   more from declining eyesight than any manual debility, had lost its
   former boldness and clearness, and had become difficult. In giving his
   commands respecting the printing, he empowered his representatives to
   use a discretion as to lesser points in the form, which has been found
   to be almost entirely needless.

   The ministers of Christ who in this and other countries remember the
   instructions of Dr. Alexander, will be best able to judge of this
   production. They will recognise in it the doctrines and arguments which
   characterized the author's theological method, and will doubtless prize
   it as a comprehensive syllabus, even while they miss that copiousness,
   vivacity, and warmth, which added efficacy to his oral teachings.

   The subject of Ethical Philosophy may be said to have engaged the mind
   of the author for at least threescore years. The earliest vestiges of
   his boyish studies show proofs of this, in connection with the
   metaphysical inquiries which afterwards became his favourite employment
   of mind. Though in after years he was almost daily adding to his
   knowledge of ethical literature, with an avidity which was unabated to
   the last, and which sought to be satisfied with the most recondite
   disquisitions in the ancient tongues no less than our own, he
   nevertheless appears to have arrived at definite conclusions very
   early, and to have maintained them with little change. It was not the
   habit of his mind, as is well known, to accumulate authorities, to load
   his discourses with learned citation, or even to break the continuity
   of his analytical discourse by unnecessary sallies against opponents.
   Amidst a life of perpetual reading, of which he held the spoils in his
   memory with singular exactness and tenacity, he persevered in seeking
   and presenting truth with the minimum of quoted aid. This quality of
   his thinking will be all the rather obvious in a treatise like the
   present, which, as an epitome of extended results, necessarily leaves
   out a thousand particulars of the process and all the lighter play of
   illustration.

   During the period of nearly forty years, in which he was theological
   professor, the author had an exercise, for the most part weekly, in
   Mental and Moral Science; as a transition from college work and a
   recapitulation of juvenile studies. The lectures thus delivered were
   the basis of the succinct manual now made public. All its parts were
   thrown into a shape suitable for the printing, except the closing
   chapters on the Being and Attributes of God, and the duties resulting
   from the relation of the Creator and creature.

   These portions not having been copied remain in autograph, and may be
   regarded as the last written speculations of one who employed his pen
   almost every day for more than half a century. If the articulation of
   this important member with the body of the discourse seem less obvious
   than might be desired, it will become sufficiently clear to such as
   reflect on the great earnestness with which, in the former part. the
   author maintains the intuitive perceptions of conscience as independent
   of every doctrine of theology, even the greatest.

   A casual inspection will be enough to show any reader that this is a
   book of elements; laying down principles, clearing the statement of
   fundamental questions, and marking limits around the science. It does
   not descend therefore to the more usual and far easier work of
   gathering, naming, and tabling the human duties. This labour he did not
   undervalue; indeed it was part of his course of instructions; and his
   unfinished manuscripts contain large contributions towards a separate
   work in this kind, embracing even all the range of duties which are
   properly Christian and even ecclesiastical. But the treatise now
   presented was intended to lay foundations and elucidate principles; in
   other words it is upon the Philosophy of Morals. At the same time,
   however, that the topics here discussed are some of the most puzzling
   which have exercised human acuteness, patience and abstraction, from
   the days of the Greek authors till our own, they are such as cannot be
   set aside or turned over to others as matter for authority; for the
   very reason that they concern the springs of daily action, are
   presented every hour in the household, and meet us in the very
   babblings of the nursery. And notwithstanding the tenuity of the
   objects brought under review, and the delicate thread of inquiry along
   which the analysis must often feel its way, the writer seems to derive
   an advantage from his unusual simplicity and transparency of language,
   which might betray a superficial reader into the opinion that the train
   of argument is not original or profound. In none of the author's works
   is this quality more apparent than in that which follows.

   One of the reasons which impelled Dr. Alexander, at a stage of life
   which was encumbered with cares and infirmities, to address himself to
   this toilsome composition, was the desire to furnish a Manual for the
   young men of America, in our colleges, theological seminaries, and
   other schools. He was repeatedly besought to supply such a volume, and
   never wavered in his persuasion that it was necessary; especially when
   he saw with pain to what an extent the place of a class-book was
   occupied by the great but dangerous work of Archdeacon Paley. In common
   with other sound ethical inquiries he recognised the value of President
   Wayland's labours, and the eloquence and richness of Dr. Chalmers's
   striking but fragmentary contributions. Yet he thought he saw room for
   a brief hand-book level to the capacity of all; and he had a natural
   and pardonable desire common to all original thinkers, to give vent to
   his own opinions in his own order. In regard to the ethical system here
   expounded, the work may safely be left to speak for itself. It is
   positive and didactic rather than controversial, yet there is scarcely
   a chapter which, however tranquil and subdued in its tone, will not
   awaken opposition in some quarter or other. The polemic aspect of the
   treatise is, however, apparent only in cases where to avoid the naming
   of opponents would have been an affectation no less than a breach of
   trust. No one, whatever his private dissent may be, will justly
   complain that his opinions have been treated with unfairness or rigour.
   The connection of ethics with theology is such that no one can treat of
   the nature of virtue, of the will, of motives, and the like, without at
   least indicating his tendencies in regard to the great dividing
   questions of revelation; which only increases the necessity for giving
   the right direction to juvenile studies; unless we would receive to the
   professional curriculum minds already pre-occupied with ethical tenets
   subversive of great truths in law, politics and theology. Those who
   have watched the progress of modern speculation will not fail to
   apprehend the drift of this observation. Yet the way in which even
   these somewhat delicate parts of moral science are here set forth, is
   such as never to awaken suspicion of any sinister intention, or to
   betray any irregular passage into a neighbouring but separate science.
   Even those discussions which, at a first view, might seem to belong
   rather to natural theology, were deliberately assigned to their place
   after long experience in teaching, as pertaining to the limits where
   the two fields osculate if they do not cut, and with a clear
   pre-eminence given to the ethical side of the truths common to both.

   The labours of the author were arrested by his last illness, when the
   work here published was complete indeed as has been said, but not ready
   for the press in the sense of being revised and corrected. It is this
   which has made these prefatory pages necessary; an introduction from
   the author's hand would have precluded all such attempts as weak and
   impertinent.

   As he gave the work in charge with his dying lips, after having no
   doubt offered it to God in many of his solicitous and elevated thoughts
   during the preparation, so it is now humbly dedicated to Him, without
   whose blessing, no human effort, even in the best cause, is other than
   worthless.

CHAPTER I.

  CONSCIENCE, OR THE MORAL FACULTY.

   As all men, when reason is developed, have a faculty by which they can
   discern a difference between objects of sight which are beautiful and
   those which are All men discern moral qualities. deformed, so all men
   possess the power of discerning a difference between actions, as to
   their moral quality. The judgment thus formed is immediate, and has no
   relation to the usefulness or injuriousness to human happiness, of the
   objects contemplated.

   Whatever difference of opinion may exist respecting the origin of this
   faculty, it is universally admitted that men, in all True in all ages
   ages and countries, have judged some actions to be good and deserving
   of approbation, while they have judged others to be bad, and of ill
   desert.

   In all languages, we find words expressive of the ideas of moral
   excellence, and moral evil. In the laws and penalties established in
   all ages throughout the Agreement of mankind. world, it is evidently
   implied that some actions ought to be done, and others avoided. In
   cases of flagrant injustice or ingratitude, all men, of every country
   and of every age, agree in their judgment of their moral evil. There
   is, in regard to such actions, no more difference in the judgment of
   men, than respecting the colour of grass, or the taste of honey. If any
   man does not perceive grass to be green, or honey to be sweet, we do
   not thence conclude that men's bodily senses are not similarly
   constituted, but that the organs of the individual who does not see and
   taste as other men do, are defective. or depraved by disease.

   Case proposed must be simple. To determine whether all men have one
   original moral faculty, the case proposed for their moral judgment
   should be simply good or evil. For a complex act, in which there is
   something good and something evil, or rather where there must be an
   accurate weighing of motives in order to ascertain the quality of the
   action, is not a proper test as to the existence of a uniformity of
   moral judgment in men. Therefore, the historical fact adduced by Dr.
   Paley, [1] from the history of Valerius Maximus, is not at all suited
   to his purpose; Case of Toranius irrelative. because the case is very
   complex, and one on which it is difficult to determine at first view,
   what the true moral character of the action is. The facts, as related
   by him, are as follows: The father of Caius Toranius had been
   proscribed by the Triumvirate. Caius Toranius--coming over to the
   interests of that party--discovered his father's place of concealment
   to the officers who were in pursuit of him, and gave them, withal, a
   description of his person by which they might distinguish him. The old
   man, more anxious for the safety and fortunes of his son than for the
   little that might remain of his own life, began immediately to inquire
   of the officers whether his son were well, and whether he had done his
   duty to the satisfaction of the generals. That son (replied one of the
   officers), so dear to thy affections, has betrayed thee to us; by his
   information thou art apprehended, and diest.' With this, the officer
   struck a poniard to his heart, and the unhappy parent fell, affected
   not so much by his fate, as by the means to which he owed it." Now, the
   question is, if this story were related to the wild boy caught some
   years ago in the woods of Hanover, or to a savage without experience
   and without instruction, cut off in his infancy from all intercourse
   with his species, and consequently under no possible influence of
   example, authority, education, sympathy, or habit, whether or not such
   a one would feel upon the relation any degree of that sentiment of
   disapprobation of Toranius's conduct which we feel.

   Why it affords no criterion. In our judgment, such a case would afford
   no criterion by which to determine whether men possess constitutionally
   a moral sense. For, in the first place, the trial would be no better
   than if the question were proposed to a child two years old, in whose
   mind the moral faculty is not yet developed. A human being, arrived at
   adult age without instruction or communication with others, would
   be--as it relates to the mind--in a state differing very little from
   that of infancy. It is not held that the moral sense will be exercised
   without the usual means by which human faculties are developed. If an
   organical defect in the brain should prevent the intellectual faculties
   from coming into exercise, the unhappy individual thus deprived of
   reason would prove nothing in regard to the operations of reason where
   it is developed. So, also, if a human being were brought up from early
   infancy in a dark dungeon, and if no information were communicated to
   him, the mental faculties would not be developed, and it would be
   absurd to have recourse to such a one to ascer tain what faculties
   belong to the human mind. The same remark will apply to the case of the
   wild boy, referred to by Dr. Paley; and also, though in an inferior
   degree, to savages of the most degraded class.

   What is meant by an original, universal faculty. Let it then be fairly
   understood what it is which is asserted in regard to conscience, as an
   original, universal faculty. It is What is meant by that every human
   mind, when its faculties have been developed, and have arrived at some
   degree of maturity, discerns a quality in certain actions which is
   termed moral; that is, it intuitively perceives that some actions are
   right and some wrong.

   Paley's instance complex. Another objection to the historical fact
   adduced by Dr. Paley, is, that it presents to the mind, not a case of
   simple, unmixed good or evil, but a complex case, in which--before a
   judgment can be formed of the action of the son--it must be decided
   whether a man ought to be governed by a regard to the welfare of a
   parent, or to the public good. If the son believed that the party in
   pursuit of his father was promoting the public good, he might feel that
   he ought to be governed by this rather than by filial affection. Here,
   then, we have presented a complex and difficult case in morals, about
   which men would be very apt to differ; and we are to determine whether
   all men--even those totally uneducated--would view it in the same
   light.

   A proper case supposed. To render the case a suitable one to be a test
   of the question under consideration, it should be supposed that the
   father was acting in conformity with the strictest principles of
   rectitude; that his life was sought by wicked men, aiming not at the
   good of the commonwealth but its destruction; and that the son, in
   betraying the place of his concealment, was actuated by mercenary
   motives, or by unjust and unnatural dislike to a good parent. If a case
   like this were presented to a thousand persons. from as many different
   parts of the world, there would be but one judgment and one feeling,
   all would judge the conduct of the son to be blamable. Different
   degrees of moral disapprobation would be felt by those whose moral
   faculty was in a cultivated state; but there would be no difference in
   the opinion entertained of his conduct. All would feel disapprobation,
   accompanied by a desire for the punishment of the offender. It is found
   that savages appear to have but an obscure exercise of conscience, but
   in proportion as their minds are cultivated, this faculty becomes more
   manifest, and operates more forcibly.

CHAPTER II.

  THE MORAL FACULTY, ORIGINAL AND UNIVERSAL.

   Moral ideas otherwise unattainable. IF conscience were not an original
   faculty, enabling us to form a conception of moral qualities, man could
   never acquire such an idea by any other means. The opinion, therefore,
   that moral feelings are merely the effect of instruction and education,
   is erroneous. For every class of simple ideas there must be an
   appropriate faculty, without which these ideas can never be acquired.
   In regard to the bodily senses, this is too evident to be called in
   question. Without the organ of vision, the simple idea of light and
   colours could never be communicated by any instructions; without the
   organ of hearing, no idea of sound can be conveyed; and so of the other
   senses. And it is equally true of that knowledge which is acquired by
   what some have called the internal senses. If there were in man no such
   faculty as taste, by which beauty is perceived, no idea of the
   beautiful could possibly be communicated. A horse has no perception of
   the beauty of a scene which perhaps enchants his rider, even though the
   animal sees all the objects with equal distinctness. So it is in regard
   to moral qualities. There must be an original faculty to give us the
   simple idea which we have of morality; otherwise the idea of virtue or
   vice could never have entered the human mind, and the feelings of moral
   obligation, of which all men are conscious, would never have been felt.

   The utilitarian objection. I am aware that those who advocate the
   utilitarian scheme, resolve all our ideas of morality and moral
   obligation into the mere principles of benefit or injury, apprehended
   to be connected with each action. Dr. Paley informs us, that the
   subject continued to be involved in impenetrable mystery, until he took
   this view of it.

   It is deemed useless to argue this point; it cannot be decided by
   reasoning. The appeal must be made to the consciousness of every man.

   Appeal to consciousness. If any one persists in declaring that he sees
   no evil in any action but as it is evidently detrimental to human
   happiness, nothing can be said in the way of argument to alter
   convictions derived from his own consciousness. All that is proper to
   be said is, that the mind of such a person is differently constituted
   from that of most men; or rather that an impartial examination of this
   subject has not been made. It is recommended to such persons carefully
   to scrutinize the exercises of their own minds; they will perceive that
   the idea of virtue or moral good is entirely distinct from that of mere
   utility. There is, indeed, a connection between these two things which
   is very intimate, and this seems to have misled many in their
   judgments. Virtuous conduct leads to happiness, and is always
   beneficial; yet our idea of its moral character is not derived from
   this consideration, but from the nature of the action itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III.

  A MORAL FACULTY BEING SUPPOSED, WHETHER ITS DICTATES ARE UNIFORM?

   Objection from alleged disagreement. ONE of the strongest objections
   which has been brought against the doctrine laid down is, that among
   men of different countries, and of entirely different education, there
   is no agreement in their judgments respecting the morality or
   immorality of the same actions. Whereas, it is alleged, that if such a
   faculty were originally a part of man's constitution, there would as
   certainly be uniformity, as in the perception of objects by the
   external senses. Now, if the dictates of conscience in men of different
   ages and countries do so much differ, does it not show that the moral
   feelings of men are just what education makes them? And what is gained
   by maintaining the existence of a moral faculty, as part of man's
   original constitution?

   Moral differences perceived by all. It will, I think, be admitted, that
   in all countries and conditions in which men have been found, there
   exists a perception of a difference in the moral character of actions;
   that is, some things are accounted wrong, which ought not to be done,
   and some right, which ought to be done.

   Total disagreement not pretended. Again, it has never been pretended as
   being a matter of fact, that between men of different countries there
   is a total difference in the opinions entertained respecting what is
   right and what is wrong. A few cases only of difference are alleged, in
   which this discrepance is observed; but in regard to those actions
   which are reckoned good or evil, there is a general agreement. As to
   those in which there seems to be a fundamental difference, an
   explanation will be given hereafter. No nation, or tribe, or class of
   mankind has ever held that it is a virtuous and proper thing to do
   injury to men, or that there is no more harm in taking away life than
   in preserving it. It has never been held that ingratitude--though
   everywhere common in practice--is a commendable thing; or that deceit
   and fraud are as praiseworthy as honesty and fair dealing.

   Proof from common estimate of character. There is in every country a
   difference made in the estimation of the character of men, derived from
   the course of their conduct. Some men are reckoned good in the public
   estimation, while others are considered wicked; the former obtain
   esteem, the latter are despised. That course of conduct which secures a
   good reputation, does not in any country consist of actions which we
   consider wicked, but of actions which in all countries are considered
   praiseworthy; and men have never obtained a bad character by a course
   of good behaviour.

   Practice does not prove absence of moral judgment. It is also important
   to observe, that the conduct of a people is not a fair test of the
   internal state of the mind, as it relates to morals. We know that
   individuals often pursue a course of conduct, which in their serious
   moments they condemn. Yet the power of temptation, and the habit of
   indulgence are such, that notwithstanding the convictions of
   conscience, they continue in a course of evil-doing. It would be a very
   inconclusive inference to determine from their habitual conduct, that
   they acted in accordance with the dictates of conscience. And what is
   true of individuals, may be true of nations and tribes. Those customs
   which they have received from their forefathers, may not meet with the
   approbation of their moral sense, and yet such is the force of an
   established custom, that they go on in the way in which they were
   brought up.

   Error is in the application. But a more satisfactory explanation of
   those facts, in which men seem conscientiously to go contrary to the
   fundamental principles of morals, is, that the principle on which they
   act is correct, but through ignorance or error they make an erroneous
   application of it.

   Infanticide. When parents murder their own female children--a thing
   very customary in China--it is on the principle that they will be
   subject to more misery than happiness in the world; and therefore it is
   doing them a favour. Here, the general principle is correct--that
   parents should consult the best interests of their offspring--but the
   mistake is in the application. The same may be said of the practice of
   exposing aged parents, when they become incapable of enjoying the
   world.

   Heathen enormities. As to those acts of cruelty which the Pagans
   perform in their religious services, (the wife committing herself to
   the flames with the body of her deceased husband; children voluntarily
   thrown into the Ganges, or persons devoting their own lives by falling
   under the car of Juggernaut,) they are performed on the principle that
   what God requires, or what pleases him, or what will secure happiness
   for ourselves or friends, should be done. It is true that the will of
   God should be obeyed, whatever sacrifice he may require; their error is
   in thinking that such sacrifices are required by Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV.

  HOW FAR ALL MEN ARE AGREED IN THEIR MORAL JUDGMENTS.

   First Truths in Morals. As the subject of morals is very extensive, and
   particular cases may be complicated, and as men are not only ignorant,
   but prejudiced by the errors received in their education, it is no more
   wonderful that they should adopt different opinions on these subjects
   than on other matters. That, however, which is true in regard to every
   department of human knowledge, is doubtless true in regard to the
   science of morals. There are certain self-evident truths, which are
   intuitively perceived by every one who has the exercise of reason, as
   soon as they are presented to the mind. In regard to these fundamental
   truths, there has never been any difference of opinion. It is not meant
   that all men distinctly think of these primary truths in morals; for
   many are Ho inattentive, or so much occupied with sensible objects,
   that they can scarcely be said ever to reflect on the subject of moral
   duty. But let an act of manifest injustice be performed before their
   eyes, and among a thousand spectators there will be but one opinion,
   and but one feeling. If a strong man, for example, violently takes away
   the property of one weaker than himself, and for no other reason than
   because he covets it, all men will condemn the act. So, if any one who
   has received from another great benefits, not only refuses to make any
   grateful return, but on the contrary, returns evil for good, all men
   will agree in judging his conduct to be wrong. All intuitively discern
   that for a ruler to punish the innocent and spare the guilty, is
   morally wrong. It is not true, in fact, that there is no agreement
   among men as to the fundamental principles of morals. Their judgments
   on these points are as uniform as on the axioms of mathematics; as in
   their agreement that the starry firmament is grand and beautiful; yea,
   as uniform as concerning the greenness of the grass, or the varied
   colours of the rainbow.

   Locke. Mr. Locke, in his zeal to disprove the existence of innate
   truths, attempts to render uncertain some of these first truths of
   morals.

   Intuitive judgments. When we go beyond these first principles, we may
   expect to find men falling into grievous error respecting moral duty;
   and this often appears in their application of general principles to
   particular cases. Most men either reason not at all, or reason badly,
   and draw from sound principles incorrect conclusions. For the most
   part, they receive implicitly what they have been taught; or they are
   governed in their opinions by the common sentiment; or they adopt as
   true what is most for their interest, or most agreeable to their
   feelings. And as men are often under the influence of feelings or
   passions which produce perturbation of mind, and so bias the judgment,
   it is easy to see how errors of judgment respecting moral conduct, in
   many cases, may spring up. And yet it is true, that there are primary
   truths in morals, in which all men agree, so soon as they are presented
   to the mind. As in other cases, by pursuing a course of sophistical
   reasonings, conclusions may be arrived at which are contradictory to
   these first principles, and this will produce perplexity; or even a
   kind of speculative assent may be yielded to such conclusions of
   ratiocination; but whenever it is necessary to form a practical
   judgment, the belief of intuitive truths must prevail. Our assent in
   these cases is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. Berkeley.
   Bishop Berkeley thought he had demonstrated that there was no external
   world; and many others thought there was no flaw in his reasoning: but
   all these speculative skeptics were, nevertheless, practical believers
   in the real existence of external objects. Atheistical and infidel
   philosophers have often endeavoured to prove that there is no intrinsic
   difference between right and wrong, and some of them probably persuaded
   themselves that this opinion was true; but these very men, when an act
   of great injustice towards themselves or friends was committed, could
   not but feel that it was morally evil; and when they saw an act of
   disinterested benevolence performed, they could not but approve it as
   morally good.

CHAPTER V.

  WHETHER CONSCIENCE IS THE SAME AS THE UNDERSTANDING, OR A FACULTY DIFFERENT
  FROM AND INDEPENDENT OF IT.

   State of the question. SOME have maintained that our moral feelings and
   judgments are the exercise of a peculiar sense, and that the
   perceptions and feelings of this sense cannot be referred to the
   understanding. Such as maintain this theory suppose, also, that the
   dictates of conscience are infallibly correct, if the mind is in a
   proper state.

   Truths premised. Others have maintained that the dictates of conscience
   are the judgments of the understanding, in regard to moral duty, and
   that, of course, an error in the judgment of the understanding must
   affect the decisions or dictates of conscience. To clear this subject,
   if possible, from all obscurity and perplexity, I would make the
   following remarks:

   The act complex. 1st. The exercise of the moral faculty, or conscience,
   is not simply an intellectual act; it is complex, including two
   things--a judgment and an emotion, or feeling of a peculiar kind.

   As judgment, it is intellectual. 2d. All judgments of the mind,
   whatever be the subject of them, appertain to the understanding. This
   comprehensive faculty includes all intellectual acts, whether relating
   to external objects, mathematical relations, natural beauty and
   sublimity, or moral duty. So far, therefore, as conscience is a
   judgment respecting any moral subject, so far it is an exercise of the
   understanding. We have not one faculty by which we discern physical
   truths, another by which we judge of mathematical theorems, and another
   for matters of taste; but all these are the one and the same
   understanding, exercised on different objects. Accordingly, when moral
   qualities are the objects of our contemplation, it is not a different
   faculty from the reason or understanding which thinks and judges, but
   the same, exercised on other subjects; and the only difference is in
   the object. Our conclusion therefore is, that so far as conscience is
   an intellectual act or judgment of the mind, so far it belongs to the
   understanding.

   3d. More than intellectual acts in conscience. But as more is included
   under the name conscience than a mere intellectual act or judgment, and
   as this judgment is attended with a peculiar feeling, called moral, and
   easily distinguished from all other emotions; and as mere emotion or
   feeling can with no propriety be referred to the reason, therefore
   conscience is, so far as this is concerned, different from the
   understanding.

   4th. Harmony of mental operations as to morals. If the moral judgments
   of the mind were from a faculty distinct from the understanding, and
   often differing from it, the harmony of the mental operations would be
   destroyed. While reason led to one conclusion, conscience might dictate
   the contrary. And upon this theory, conscience must always be correct,
   unless the faculty be morbid.

   How far conscience is of reason. All experience and history show that
   men may act under the influence of an erroneous conscience. The
   dictates of conscience are always in conformity with the practical
   judgments of reason. When these are erroneous, conscience is erroneous.
   The conclusion therefore is that conscience is not a distinct faculty
   from reason, so far as it consists in a judgment of the quality of
   moral acts. Reason or understanding is the genus; the judgments of
   conscience are the species. Reason has relation to all intelligible
   subjects; the moral faculty is conversant about moral qualities alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI.

  THE MORAL SENSE COMPARED WITH TASTE,

   The term moral sense. FROM what was said in the preceding chapter, it
   appears that conscience, or the moral sense, is not a simple but a
   compound faculty, including both an intellectual act or judgment, and a
   peculiar feeling or emotion. The name moral sense was probably adopted
   to express this feeling, or internal emotion. It will serve perhaps to
   illustrate this subject, if we bring into view another faculty, between
   which and the moral sense there is a remarkable analogy. I refer to
   what is commonly called Taste, or that faculty by which men are in some
   degree capable of perceiving and relishing the beauties of nature and
   art. In this there is a judgment respecting that quality denominated
   Beauty, but there is also a vivid emotion of a peculiar kind,
   accompanying this judgment. The external objects in which beauty is
   resident, might be distinctly seen, and yet no such quality be
   perceived; as was before mentioned in regard to certain animals, whose
   sight and hearing is more acute than those of men, and which yet appear
   to be utterly insensible of the quality called beauty.

   Analogy between judgments of taste and conscience. If the question
   should be raised whether Taste is merely an exercise of the
   understanding, the proper answer would be precisely as in the case of
   conscience, viz., so far as it consists in judgment, it appertains to
   the intellectual faculty; but so far as it consists in emotion, it does
   not. And in this, as in matters of conscience, errors of judgment will
   affect the emotions produced. In cultivating Taste, it is of the utmost
   importance that correct opinions be adopted in relation to the objects
   of this faculty. The question may perhaps be asked, why either of these
   should be considered a distinct faculty of the mind. In regard to
   mental faculties or powers, there is a want of agreement among
   philosophers, as to what is requisite to entitle any mental operation
   to be referred to a distinct and original faculty. Whether in either
   case a distinct faculty. In these two cases, there exists in the mind a
   capacity for perceiving peculiar qualities in certain appropriate
   objects. Though the ideas of beauty and morality are judgments of the
   understanding, it requires a faculty suited to the objects, to enable
   the understanding to obtain the simple ideas of beauty and morality. We
   can conceive of a rational mind without such a capacity. There is also
   in these faculties, the susceptibility of a peculiar emotion,
   dissimilar from all others; and these two things constitute the faculty
   of Taste or Conscience. But it is a matter of no importance whether
   taste and conscience be called distinct and original faculties, if what
   has been said respecting their nature be admitted.

   Original susceptibility in both. There is in the human mind a capacity
   of discerning what is termed beauty, in the works of nature and art.
   This judgment is accompanied by a pleasurable emotion, and to this
   capacity or susceptibility we give the name Taste. There is also a
   power of discerning moral qualities, which conception is also attended
   with a vivid emotion; and to this power or faculty we give the name
   Conscience, or the moral faculty. Both these are so far original parts
   of our constitution, that if there did not exist in every mind a sense
   of beauty and its contrary, and a sense of right and wrong, such ideas
   could be generated, or communicated by no process of education.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII.

  MORAL OBLIGATION.

   Obligation. MUCH has been written to explain the true ground of moral
   obligation. But the subject has been rather darkened and perplexed than
   elucidated, by these comments. It is always so when men undertake to
   explain that which is so clear that it needs no explanation.

   Included in every idea of morality. Every idea of morality includes in
   it that of moral obligation. A moral act is one which ought to be
   performed; an immoral act, is one which ought not to be performed. As
   soon as we get the conception of a moral act, we receive with it the
   idea of moral obligation. It would be a contradiction to say that any
   act was moral, and yet that there was no obligation to perform it. What
   a moral act is. One of the best definitions which can be given of a
   moral act, is that it is an act which we are bound to perform, and of
   an immoral act, that it is one which ought not to be done. The more
   clearly we see any thing to be moral, the more sensibly we feel
   ourselves under a moral obligation to perform it. This being a matter
   of common intuition, and universal experience, all that is necessary to
   convince us of its truth, is to bring it distinctly before our minds.
   There is therefore no need to look any further for the grounds and
   reasons of moral obligation, than to the morality of the act itself, as
   this idea is involved in every conception of morality.

   Why we are obliged to do right--not to be asked. The following citation
   from Dr. Price's work on Morals, is in accordance with the view just
   given: "From the account given of obligation, it appears how absurd it
   is to inquire, what obliges us to practise virtue? as if obligation
   were no part of the idea of virtue, but something adventitious and
   foreign to it: that is, as if what was our duty might not be our duty;
   as if it might not be true, that what is fit to do, we ought to do, and
   that what we ought to do, we are obliged to do. To ask why we are
   obliged to practise virtue, to abstain from what is wicked, or perform
   what is just, is the very same as to ask why we are obliged to do what
   we are obliged to do. It is not possible to avoid wondering at those
   who have so unaccountably embarrassed themselves, on a subject that one
   would think was attended with so little difficulty: and who, because
   they cannot find any thing in virtue and duty themselves, which can
   induce and oblige us to pay a regard to them--fly to self-love, and
   maintain that from hence alone are derived all inducement and
   obligation." Answer of Archdeacon Paley. Dr. Paley commences his second
   book on Moral Philosophy, by an inquiry into the nature of moral
   obligation. He asks, "Why am I obliged to keep my word?" and mentions
   several answers which would be given by different persons, and which he
   says all coincide. But he goes on to say that all the answers leave the
   matter short; for the inquirer may turn round upon his teacher with a
   second question, "Why am I obliged to do what is right, to act
   agreeably to the fitness of things, to conform to reason, nature or
   truth, to promote the public good, or to do the will of God?"

   Insufficient. All this, it appears to us, is fitted to mystify as plain
   a subject as ever engaged the thoughts of a rational mind, and is
   designed to remove the true ground of moral obligation, and reduce all
   such obligation to the single principle of self-love, or the tendency
   of an act to promote individual happiness.

   The inquiry unreasonable. Suppose then, after Dr. Paley had made all
   obligation to rest on the ground that the performance of a good act
   promotes our eternal happiness, the inquirer should again ask, "Why am
   I bound to perform that which will promote my happiness?" The question,
   indeed, would be unreasonable, because all men are agreed that
   happiness is a good; but is it not equally unreasonable, when an action
   is seen to be virtuous, or morally right, to ask "Why am I obliged to
   do it?" The moment we see a thing to be morally right, the sense of
   obligation is complete, and all further inquiring for reasons why I am
   obliged to do right is as absurd as would be inquiring for reasons why
   I should pursue happiness.

   Intuitive certainty is ultimate. Where we have intuitive certainty of
   any thing it is foolish to seek for other reasons. If there is any
   thing clear in the view of a rational mind, it is this: that virtue
   should be practised, that what is right should be done. But still
   further to perplex this plain subject, Dr. Paley has undertaken to
   inform us what is meant by obligation. "A man," says he, "is said to be
   obliged when he is urged by a violent motive resulting from the will of
   another."

   Paley's definition. This is, indeed, a very extraordinary definition.
   The motive, he says, must be violent; but what should hinder that a
   motive not violent should create an obligation according to its force?
   The main error of this definition is that it confounds moral obligation
   with other motives of an entirely different kind. The obligation of
   which he speaks, is created by the will or command of another. The law
   of a tyrant requiring his subjects to do what is evidently wrong cannot
   create a moral obligation. A rational being may be urged by the threats
   of a tyrant, on the universal principle of self-love, and this force
   may, by an abuse of terms, be called an obligation; but according to
   the common usage of the language, when a man is said to be under
   obligation to perform an act, we mean that he is morally bound. But
   whether the operation of any violent motive, resulting from the will of
   another, may be said to oblige a man or not, the main inquiry is, what
   is the ground of moral obligation? The difference between a moral
   obligation and other motives which may oblige should be kept in view.

   Paley's account of obligation. He then returns to the question, "Why am
   I obliged to keep my word?" and applies the preceding definition of the
   nature of obligation, and gives the following answer: "Because I am
   urged to do so by a violent motive (namely, the expectation of being
   after this life rewarded if I do, or punished if I do not), resulting
   from the command of another (namely, of God)." He goes on to say, "When
   I first turned my attention to moral speculations, an air of mystery
   seemed to hang over the whole subject, which arose, I believe, from
   hence; that I supposed with many authors whom I had consulted that to
   be obliged to do a thing, was different from being induced to do it;
   and that the obligation to practise virtue, and to do what is justice,
   is quite another thing and of another kind from the obligation which a
   soldier is under to obey his officer, or a servant his master, or any
   of the ordinary obligations of human life."

   Erroneous. We cannot but be of the opinion that Dr. Paley has here made
   a radical mistake, which it is exceedingly important to consider,
   since, unhappily for sound morals, his system is so much employed in
   the instruction of youth.

   The theory of morals, of which the above principle is a part, is no
   other than this: that the only difference between virtue and vice,
   consists in their tendency, respectively, to promote or hinder the
   happiness of the individual; Paley's scheme of morals. so that if a man
   could persuade himself that no evil would arise to him from telling a
   lie, he would be under no obligation to speak the truth. It is a scheme
   of morals which obliterates all intrinsic difference between virtue and
   vice, and makes the one preferable to the other on no other account
   than its tendency to promote individual happiness in the future world.

   Difficulties of the hypothesis. If a man does not believe in a future
   world, he can, according to this theory, feel no obligation to keep his
   word. We believe, on the contrary, that moral obligation is felt by the
   atheist, and that he cannot divest himself of it. When men are tempted
   by some strong motive to deviate from the truth, and yet are enabled to
   resist the temptation, there is in most cases no distinct consideration
   of any future good to be gained by it, but the man feels himself under
   an obligation to do that which is in itself right. The conflict is not
   between a greater and a less happiness, but between the prospect of
   happiness and moral obligation.

   On this subject, the appeal must be to the common judgment of men. And
   we are persuaded that this confounding of moral obligation with motives
   of another kind, is a radical defect in Dr. Paley's system,
   which--lying at the foundation--vitiates the whole, and has already
   been the cause of great evil to society.

   True doctrine stated. The true doctrine is, that virtue and vice are
   distinct and opposite, and that when we know any act to be right, we
   are bound--aside from all considerations of self-interest--to perform
   it.

   The opposite doctrine. Dr. Paley maintains that "we can be obliged to
   nothing, unless we are to lose or gain something by it, for nothing
   else can be a violent motive' to us. And as we should not be obliged to
   obey the laws or the magistrate, unless rewards or punishments,
   pleasure or pain, somehow or other depended on our obedience; so
   neither should we, without the same reason, be obliged to do what is
   right, to practise virtue, or to obey the command of God."

   Virtue thus made mercenary. According to this view, unless a man is
   persuaded that he shall gain something by keeping his word, he is under
   no obligation to do it. Even if God should clearly make known his will,
   and lay upon him his command, he is under no obligation to obey, unless
   certain that he shall receive benefit by so doing. This is, indeed, to
   make virtue a mercenary thing, and reduce all motives to a level. And
   as self-love, or the desire of happiness, is the only rational motive,
   and all men possess this in a sufficient degree of strength, the only
   conceivable difference between the good and the bad, consists in the
   superior sagacity which the one has above the other to discern what
   will most contribute to happiness. And if what we call vice or sin
   could be made to contribute to happiness, then it would change its
   nature and become virtue.

   Paley's definition obscure. The definition of obligation, given by Dr.
   Paley, upon his own principles, is unnecessarily encumbered with what
   adds nothing to its import. Why should the "violent motive" result from
   the command of another? The command of another ought to have no
   influence, except as obedience or disobedience will be attended with
   loss or gain. It would, therefore, have been more simple and
   intelligible to say at once, what is certainly implied, that the only
   motive which can oblige us to be virtuous, is the expectation of the
   happiness to be derived from such conduct in the future world.

   The honestum and the utile. Cicero, in his work "De Finibus," says that
   those men who confounded the honestum with the utile, deserved to be
   banished from society. The result of the whole scheme is, that there is
   no such thing as moral excellence, abstractly considered; that the only
   good in the universe is happiness; and that other things, among which
   virtue is included, are good only as related to this end. If this is
   true, the moral attributes of God have no intrinsic excellence; they
   are all merged in his infinite felicity. Surely this view is not suited
   to increase our reverence for the Supreme Being.

   Appeal to primary ideas. But every man who carefully examines into his
   own primary ideas of morality, will find that he has a sense of right
   and wrong, independent of all considerations of personal happiness, or
   its loss. This distinction is too deeply engraven on the mind to be
   erased by any process of reasoning.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII.

  THE SUPREMACY OF CONSCIENCE

   Conscience must be obeyed. THAT the dictates of conscience should be
   obeyed, is one of the most evident perceptions of the human mind. No
   matter how much might be gained by going contrary to conscience, every
   honest mind has the same judgment, that duty should be done. If it is
   plain that a certain act--such as confessing the truth of the
   gospel--is a duty, and we are convinced that no. thing but suffering
   will ensue from performing it; yet the judgment of the impartial mind
   is, that no prospect of pain or loss can ever justify us in denying the
   truth, or in doing any thing else that we know to be wrong. On this
   point, there is no room for reasoning. The judgment that conscience
   should be obeyed, is intuitive: all men must acknowledge it, unless
   they belie the clear convictions of their own reason.

   Admitted maxim. That conscience should be obeyed, that duty should be
   performed at every risk, are maxims which must receive the assent of
   all who are capable of understanding them. On the subject of the
   supremacy of conscience, the following quotation from Dr. Chalmers, is
   very much to our purpose:

   Chalmers. "In every human heart there is a faculty--not, it may be,
   having the actual power, but having the just and rightful pretension to
   act as judge and master over the whole of human conduct. Other
   propensities may have too much sway, but the moral propensity--if I may
   so term it--never can; for, to have the presiding sway in all our
   concerns, is just that which properly and legitimately belongs to it. A
   man under anger, may be too strongly prompted to deeds of retaliation,
   or under sensuality may be too strongly prompted to indulgence, or
   under avarice, be too closely addicted to the pursuit of wealth, or
   even under friendship be too strongly inclined to partiality; but he
   never can, under conscience, be too strongly inclined to be as he
   ought, and to do as he ought. We may say of a watch, that its
   main-spring is too powerful, but we would never say that a regulator
   was too powerful." . . . . . . . "And neither do we urge the
   proposition that conscience has in every instance the actual direction
   of human affairs, for this were in the face of all experience. It is
   not that every man obeys her dictates, but that every man feels that he
   Ought to obey them. These dictates are often, in life and practice,
   disregarded; so that conscience is not the sovereign de facto.
   Conscience is sovereign.Still there is a voice within the hearts of all
   which asserts that conscience is the sovereign de jure: that to her
   belongs the command rightfully, even though she do not possess it
   actually.". . . . "All that we affirm is, that if conscience prevail
   over the other principles, then every man is led, by the very make and
   mechanism of his internal economy, to feel, that it is as it ought to
   be; or if these others prevail over conscience, that it is not as it
   ought to be.".... "When stating the supremacy of conscience, in the
   sense that we have explained it, we but state what all men feel; and
   our only argument in proof of the assertion is--our only argument can
   be, an appeal to the experience of all men."

   Inward verdict. These sentiments will find a response in every honest
   mind. However often we disobey the voice of this monitor, we always
   have the feeling of self-condemnation accompanying our disobedience.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX.

  WHETHER WE ALWAYS DO RIGHT BY OBEYING THE DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE?

   Difficulty of the problem. THIS is one of the most perplexing questions
   in the science of morals. Many are of opinion that all that is
   necessary to render an action good is that the agent act agreeably to
   the dictates of his own conscience. This may be considered a vulgar
   opinion, usually taken up without much consideration. But there is an
   opinion, near akin to this, which has been advocated by some of the
   greatest men of the age; namely, that men are not responsible for their
   opinions or belief. It is thought that the adoption of this as a maxim
   is the only effectual method of putting an end to the bitter
   animosities and controversies among the advocates of different creeds.

   Source of error. It is not wonderful that they who make the moral
   sense, in a sort, infallible, and the ultimate standard of right and
   wrong, should hold that men cannot go astray if they will honestly
   listen to the voice of conscience, and obey her dictates.

   Error of understanding may affect moral judgments. But as we have shown
   that conscience is the judgment of the mind respecting duty, and as no
   man's knowledge is perfect or infallible, it follows, therefore, that
   so far as there is error in the understanding in relation to matters of
   duty, just so far the conscience will be misguided. The question at
   issue, therefore, is whether an action, wrong in itself, can be
   considered as a good and virtuous action if the agent believes that it
   is right. Otherwise truth would be needless. If the affirmative were
   true, then the discovery of truth would be of no value, for obviously
   upon this principle error is just as good as truth. But as soon would
   we believe that darkness is as good as light to direct us in the way
   which we wish to travel. Again, this theory supposes that a man is
   under no law but his own opinion, or the dictates of conscience;
   Opinion would be law. that, therefore, which is a sin in one man may be
   a duty to another in precisely the same external circumstances and
   relations; which would be to confound all moral distinctions. This
   theory would go to sanction every form of religion, however corrupt and
   superstitious; False religion would be right. and to make the vilest
   immoralities virtuous; for there can be no doubt that the votaries of
   idolatry, in their most cruel and abominable rites, follow the dictates
   of an erring conscience. When the heathen sacrifice to demons, and when
   the victim is a human being, or even a first-born son, there is nothing
   wrong, for all these acts of worship are performed in obedience to
   conscience. Every species of persecution and the Inquisition itself may
   be justified on this principle. Instead, therefore, of putting an end
   to all animosity, it would bring back, in all their horrors, the days
   of persecution for conscience' sake.

   On this subject, again, our appeal must be to the unbiassed judgment of
   mankind; and we think the verdict will be, that error which might have
   been avoided, and ignorance, which is not invincible, do not excuse.
   Avoidable and unavoidable. The knowledge necessary to duty is within
   the reach of every man, were he disposed sincerely to seek after it.
   But it is a truth which is of importance on this subject, that one
   false step leads to another; and though a man who has adopted
   fundamental error, labours under a kind of necessity to do wrong, yet
   this does not excuse him, because he ought to have exercised more
   diligence and impartiality in seeking for the truth, and is justly
   liable to all the evil consequences resulting from this neglect.

   Duty of correcting errors. Suppose a man to have been educated in a
   wrong system of religion and morals; he is responsible, because, when
   arrived at the years of maturity, he should have brought the opinions
   received by education under an honest examination. The more difficult
   it is to divest ourselves of prejudices thus imbibed, as it were, with
   the mother's milk, the more necessary is it that, under the influence
   of a sincere love of truth, we should, with impartiality, diligence,
   and resolution, endeavour to do so. It is no proof that such a course
   is not the solemn duty of man, that few ever perform it. The prevalence
   of error in the world, is very much owing to the neglect of this duty.
   This neglect arises from culpable indolence, from a desire to remain in
   agreement with the multitude or with our parents and teachers, from
   aversion to the truth and an unwillingness to deny ourselves, and incur
   the inconvenience and persecution which an avowal of the truth would
   bring upon us.. But none of these reasons will justify us in adhering
   to opinions which are detrimental to ourselves and others, or contrary
   to our moral obligations. It is true, if a man's conscience dictates a
   certain action, he is morally bound to obey; but if that action is in
   itself wrong, he commits sin in performing it, nevertheless. He who is
   under fundamental error, is in a sad dilemma. Do what he will, he sins.
   If he disobey conscience, he knowingly sins; doing what he believes to
   be wrong; and a man never can be justified for doing what he believes
   to be wrong, even though it should turn out to be right. And if he obey
   conscience, performing an act which is in itself wrong, he sins;
   because he complies not with the law under which he is placed. It may
   be asked, "How can a man be responsible in such circumstances, when he
   is under a necessity of doing wrong?" The seat of responsibility in
   such a case. We are responsible for suffering ourselves to be brought
   into such a state; we are responsible for our ignorance of the truth.
   Hence we see how important the duty of seeking after truth with
   untiring diligence, and honest impartiality. The same necessity is
   found to arise from forming bad habits, and cherishing evil passions.
   The heart in which envy to another has been indulged until it has
   become habitual, cannot exercise kind and brotherly affections to that
   person; but this is no excuse. The fault may be traced far back, but
   guilt is attached to every act of envy, however inveterate the habit.
   If this were not so, the greater the sinner, the less his
   responsibility.

   Objection, that belief is involuntary. The objection to making a man
   responsible for his opinions, is, that his belief does not depend upon
   his will, but results necessarily from the evidence existing before the
   mind, at any moment. This is true; but we may turn our minds away from
   the evidence which would have produced a conviction of the truth. And
   this is not all; there may be such a state of mind, that evidence of a
   certain kind cannot be perceived. Depravity produces blindness of mind,
   in regard to the beauty and excellency of moral objects. But every man
   ought to be free from such a state or temper of mind, as produces
   distorted or erroneous views. Surely, moral depravity cannot be an
   excuse for erroneous opinions. All actions proceed from certain
   principles; if, therefore, the action is wrong, because of the corrupt
   principle, the burden of culpability must be rolled back upon the
   principle, or state of the soul, which sends forth evil acts, as a
   poisoned fountain sends forth deleterious streams.

   Metaphysical reasoning, however, rather perplexes and obscures than
   elucidates such points. Let us hold fast by the plain principles of
   common sense, and appeal to the common judgment of mankind; Avoidable
   ignorance does not excuse. and the decision will be, that ignorance or
   error which might have been avoided, never excuses from blame. The same
   is true of all evil habits and inveterate passions, which have been
   voluntarily or heedlessly contracted. The whole course of a moral agent
   must be taken together; his moral acts are complicated, and intimately
   connected. They form a web, in which one thread is connected with
   another, and one serves to give strength to another. If we honestly
   consult our conscience, we feel guilty when we have done wrong, even
   though we did it ignorantly; because we ought not to have been in
   ignorance.

   What constitutes a right action. Two things, therefore, are necessary,
   in order to determine that an action is right: first, that the state of
   mind of the agent be such as it ought to be; and secondly, that the
   action be in conformity with the law under which we are placed; for the
   very idea of morality supposes us to be under a moral law.

   Duty not fulfilled by obeying erroneous conscience. While, then, we
   cannot do better than obey conscience; yet if conscience is erroneous,
   we do not fulfil our duty by such obedience, but may commit grievous
   sin. For, following the dictates of conscience, is only one
   circumstance essential to a good action. When we do wrong while obeying
   the dictates of conscience, the error does not consist in that
   obedience, but in not following the right rule, with which rule the
   accountable moral agent should be acquainted.

CHAPTER X.

  WHETHER THERE IS IN THE MIND A LAW OR RULE, BY WHICH MAN JUDGES OF THE
  MORALITY OF PARTICULAR ACTIONS?

   Mental rules are objects of consciousness. IF such a rule existed in
   the mind prior to the observation of particular acts of a moral nature,
   we should be conscious of it: no thing of the nature of a law or rule
   can have existence in the mind, without the knowledge of the mind
   itself.

   The actual process of the mind in moral judgments. There seems to be a
   common mistake as to the process of the mind in regard to general
   principles. It seems to be thought that in order to judge whether an
   action be right or wrong, there must be something like a general rule
   or law, which the mind applies, as the workman does his rule, to
   ascertain whether the quality of the action be good or bad. But as we
   are conscious of no such process as the application of a general rule,
   there seems to be no evidence whatever of its existence. The real
   process of the mind is very simple. When a moral action is viewed, if
   its nature is simple and palpable, the mind intuitively perceives its
   quality, and is conscious of no other mental process. Suppose a man,
   created as Adam was, in the full possession of his rational faculties:
   until some occasion offered, to elicit its exercise, he would not be
   conscious of any moral faculty or feeling. But suppose an act of
   flagrant injustice to be perpetrated before him, he would at once have
   his moral faculty brought into exercise. He would see that the action
   had in it a moral turpitude, that it ought not to have been done, and
   that the agent deserved to be punished. So long as this was the only
   moral act observed or thought of, there would be in the mind nothing
   but the judgment, with the accompanying feeling that such an act, and
   of course every other act of the same kind, was evil. As such an
   observer would, however, soon observe a multitude of acts, of different
   kinds, which were judged to be good or bad, a general rule or law would
   be obtained, by degrees, out of these particulars. The process of the
   mind, in all cases, is from particulars to generals, and the tendency
   in the mind to put into classes those things which resemble each other,
   exists also in regard to moral actions. After observing a great number
   of acts, of different kinds, all of which are morally good or evil,
   these particulars are classified, and form a general rule or law; and
   when a new act is observed, it is referred to its proper class. But how
   can we know an action to be good or bad, without a rule with which to
   compare it, in the first instance? The answer is, that it is as easy to
   conceive of a faculty by which we can at once perceive the moral
   character of an act, as of the power of judging of the rectitude of a
   general rule.

   Whether the moral faculty has the rule in itself. There is a sense in
   which it may be said, that reason, or the moral faculty having the
   power of discerning the moral quality of actions, has the rule in
   itself. If this is all that is intended by a general rule of right and
   wrong in the mind, there can be no objection to it. This is saying no
   more than that the mind has a faculty by which it judges intuitively of
   many moral acts, as soon as they are observed. The idea may be thus
   illustrated: here is a straight line, as soon as I see it, I perceive
   it to be straight; there is a crooked line, which at once I perceive to
   be crooked. There is no need of a rule in the mind, by the application
   of which I know that the one is straight, and the other crooked. The
   quality of the lines is seen at once. So of many moral actions, the
   moment the mind apprehends them, their moral character is perceived.

   A case stated. Here are some boys going to school. I observe one, who
   is large and strong, forcibly taking from another, who is small and
   weak, some fruit which the latter has with much pains gathered for a
   sick mother. I need no general rule to guide my judgment. I need only
   to know the real circumstances of the action. That a large and strong
   boy should by force take away from one weaker than himself, property to
   which he has no right, and to which the other has a right, is so
   evidently immoral, that every mind sees the evil at once.

   General law of morals from particular acts. The general law or rule of
   morals is therefore made up by the observation and classification of
   particular acts; just as the general law of gravity is formed by
   observation of particular facts.

   Analogy of other generalizations. All our knowledge relates originally
   to particular cases; and general ideas and general rules and laws, are
   formed by a process of the mind, which may be called generalization or
   classification.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI.

  THE MORAL FEELING WHICH ACCOMPANIES EVERY MORAL JUDGMENT.

   Feelings of approbation and disapprobation. WHETHER our judgments and
   feelings are distinct and separate mental exercises, or whether what we
   call feeling or emotion is only an idea of a more vivid kind, is a
   question which we need not discuss, as the decision of it is not
   necessary to our purpose. All men make a distinction between acts which
   are purely intellectual, and those exercises of mind called emotions;
   and no practical error can arise from observing this
   distinction--whether philosophically correct or not. In every case
   where a moral object or relation comes before the mind, there is a
   feeling of approbation or disapprobation, according to the moral
   character of the object, of which we are immediately conscious. This
   approbation or disapprobation will not be equal in all cases, but
   exceedingly different in degree. While some moral actions elicit, when
   perceived, a very slight degree of approbation or disapprobation,
   others excite strong emotion; the disapproval arising to indignation,
   and the approval to admiration.

   The idea or merit. In every instance where a good act is observed,
   there is a feeling of esteem for the agent, as well as approbation of
   the act. A disposition, too, is felt to bestow some reward on the
   person who performs a good action. If we see a man, at the imminent
   risk of his own life, plunge into the sea to save a stranger who has
   fallen overboard, we approve the action, and feel that he deserves a
   reward. We therefore call it a meritorious action; for the simple idea
   of merit is that which deserves a reward. The vindicatory feeling.

   On the other hand, when we are witnesses of a wicked act of an enormous
   kind, as, for example, a man murdering a good parent or a kind
   benefactor, without any provocation, but instigated by avarice or
   resentment--we feel instantaneously a degree of disapprobation which
   may properly be called indignation. This feeling would be accompanied
   by a strong desire that condign punishment should be inflicted on the
   wicked perpetrator of such a deed. If there were no other means of
   executing justice, we should feel disposed to aid in punishing the
   culprit; and the idea of such a person escaping without punishment, is
   painful to the impartial mind, and revolting to the moral feelings.

   Degrees in moral emotions. These moral emotions are, however, of very
   different degrees of intensity in different persons, and in the same
   person at different periods of his life. Persons who have been long
   accustomed to see atrocious crimes committed, lose in time their moral
   sensibility, and become accustomed to scenes of blood and robbery. In
   proportion as the minds of men are enlightened by the truth, and their
   hearts upright, will be the sensibility of the moral faculty. But by
   committing sin, as well as by observing it, the moral sensibilities are
   blunted. This want of right feeling in the conscience is what is called
   a "seared conscience," which expression is borrowed from the effect
   produced on any part of a living body, by the repeated application of a
   heated iron. The result is, that, by degrees, the skin thickens, and
   the sensibility of the seared part is lost, or rendered obtuse.

   Emotion in regard to acts as our own. Besides this feeling of
   approbation or disapprobation of moral acts, good or evil, there is a
   peculiar emotion, in relation to moral acts, according to their nature,
   when performed by ourselves. In this case, the emotion is much more
   vivid than when we contemplate the same action as performed by another.
   When a person is conscious of having performed a truly good action, and
   from the proper motives, he experiences an emotion of pleasure, of a
   very peculiar and exalted nature. For this emotion, we have no
   distinctive name; it may be called the pleasure of a good or approving
   conscience. It must not be confounded with self-complacency, or a proud
   opinion of our own worth, which may also arise from the performance of
   a meritorious action. The feeling of which mention has been made, is a
   simple emotion arising in the mind, from the principles of the human
   constitution, upon the performance of a good action. One reason why it
   has not been more noticed is, that it has no distinctive name. The
   emotion experienced on the performance of a wicked action is well known
   to every one. It has a distinctive appellation--remorse. It is a
   feeling distinguishable from all others, and more intolerable than any
   other species of pain. When violent, it often drives the unhappy
   subject of it to the most desperate acts. It is like a scorpion,
   stinging the soul in its tenderest part. No language can exaggerate the
   misery of a soul abandoned to the torture of this feeling. And though
   in time it may seem to be allayed by forgetfulness of the crime, yet
   when any circumstance or association brings the evil action distinctly
   before the conscience, the torment is renewed. Thus, acts of iniquity
   committed in heedless gayety, often produce sensible remorse in the
   time of solitude and reflection; and the sins of youth embitter old
   age. This feeling often accompanies the sinner to his times of decline,
   and is the pain which most annoys him on his bed of death. As the
   feeling accompanies the guilty unto the last moment of their earthly
   existence, there is much reason to think that it will cause the
   bitterest anguish of a future state.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII.

  BELIEF IN GOD, AS CONNECTED WITH THE OPERATION OF CONSCIENCE.

   The question stated. THE question is, whether an atheist is completely
   divested of the feeling of moral obligation. To those who suppose that
   speculative atheism is impossible, this question will appear
   irrelevant; for it would be useless to inquire what would be the effect
   of a state of mind which never can exist.

   The atheist perceives right and wrong. As, however, the evidences of
   the actual existence of atheism are as strong as those of most other
   fundamental errors; and as the doctrine of certain ideas being
   impressed on the mind in its creation (on which the opinion that men
   could not become atheists was founded), is now generally exploded, it
   may be here taken as admitted that there are atheists in the world, The
   question proposed is therefore a proper subject for consideration.
   Bishop Warburton in his "Divine Legation of Moses," seems to adopt the
   opinion, that a belief in the being of God, is requisite to the
   exercise of conscience, or the sense of moral obligation. But his
   reasonings on the subject are by no means satisfactory. If we may refer
   to the experience of the atheist himself, he will assure us, that he
   perceives the difference between right and wrong, as plainly as others,
   and that he is conscious of being under a moral obligation to pursue a
   virtuous course. This, however, they consider an instinctive or
   constitutional principle, which should be obeyed, just as our appetites
   and other natural propensities should be obeyed.

   Intuitive perceptions not dependent on other knowledge. If there are
   intuitive perceptions of moral relations, when actions of a certain
   kind are presented to the view of the rational mind, then it is certain
   that conscience may and will operate, whatever may be the opinions of
   the person on other subjects. No one, when he contemplates an act of
   flagrant injustice, is conscious of a reference to the existence of a
   moral Governor, prior to his moral judgment of the quality of the
   action. The perception of its moral evil is as immediate as that of the
   colour of the sky, or the grass. Objection and answer. But how can a
   man feel a moral obligation, unless he admits that there is a superior
   to whom he is bound? how can he feel himself under a law, unless there
   is a law-giver? The answer is, that this part of the human constitution
   furnishes a conclusive argument in favour of the being of God. We have
   a law written within us, and from the sense of obligation to obey this
   law, we cannot escape. The great Creator has not left himself without a
   witness, in the breast of every man. It is possible that a man may be
   so abandoned as to believe in lies, and that he may come to disbelieve
   in the God that made and supports him. But he cannot obliterate the law
   written on his heart; he cannot divest himself of the conviction that
   certain actions are morally wrong; nor can he prevent the stings of
   remorse, when he commits sins of an enormous kind Men may, indeed, spin
   out refined metaphysical theories, and come to the conclusion that
   there is no difference between virtue and vice, and that these
   distinctions are the result of education. But let some one commit a
   flagrant act of injustice toward themselves, and their practical
   judgment will give the lie to their theoretical opinion.

   Moral distinctions cannot be reasoned away. As those speculatists who
   argue that there is no external world, will avoid running against a
   post, or into the fire, as carefully as other men; so they who
   endeavour to reason themselves into the belief that virtue and vice are
   mere notions, generated by education, cannot, nevertheless, avoid
   perceiving that some actions are base, unjust, or ungrateful, and
   consequently to be disapproved of, whether committed by themselves or
   others.

   Conscience cannot be destroyed. The inferences from what has been said
   are, that by no arts or course of conduct can men so eradicate the
   moral faculty, that there shall no longer be any sense of right and
   wrong. And again, it is evident that, although the belief of the
   existence of God is not necessary to the operation of conscience, yet
   from the existence of this faculty the existence of God may be
   inferred.

   Dictates of conscience modified by belief in God. And finally, that
   although the atheist cannot destroy the moral faculty, yet the firmer
   the belief of God's existence, and the clearer the knowledge of his
   attributes, the more distinct and forcible will be the dictates of
   conscience. More over, while the blindness of atheism continues there
   will of course be no perception of the moral duties which arise out of
   our relation to the great Creator; and thus the largest and most
   important class of moral actions will be out of view. And this is true,
   to a great degree in regard to the practical atheist, who forgets God
   habitually; he feels very little sense of obligation to worship and
   serve him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII.

  MORAL AGENCY, AND WHAT IS NECESSARY TO IT.

   The question to be determined by experience. AS actions of moral agents
   are the proper and only objects of moral approbation or disapprobation,
   it becomes necessary to institute an inquiry into the nature of moral
   agency; or into what are the constituents of a moral agent. The
   decision of this question must depend entirely on experience, and can
   never be determined by reasoning on abstract principles. The process is
   simply this: we contemplate a great variety of acts, which by the moral
   faculty we judge to possess a moral character. We next examine the
   circumstances in which those acts were performed, and we conclude those
   things which are found in all of them, to be necessary to moral agency.
   Or, to render the examination more simple, we may suppose some one
   condition of the action to be absent, and then another, and then
   viewing the action as thus changed in its circumstances, we may bring
   it before the mind, and if the moral quality of the act appear
   unchanged, we conclude that that which has been removed from it is no
   essential circumstance in moral agency. But if the change in the
   circumstances of the action, leads all men to take an entirely
   different view of its nature, then we conclude that this circumstance
   is essential to moral agency. Instance touching moral agency. To
   illustrate this principle, let us suppose the following case: If we see
   a man suddenly, without any apparent provocation, raise his hand and
   strike another, believing that it was freely done, by a man comnpos
   mentis, we feel a strong disapprobation of the act, as immoral and
   deserving punishment. But if on inquiry it is ascertained that the
   person who committed the assault was utterly destitute of reason, we
   may blame his keepers or friends who left him at liberty, but we no
   longer feel any moral disapprobation of the act. For it is the
   intuitive judgment of all persons, that a man destitute of reason is
   not a moral agent, nor accountable for his actions, whatever evil may
   be produced. We consider such a man as exactly in the same predicament
   as a wild beast which does an injury. This is the common judgment of
   men; for in all courts of justice, when a man is arraigned for an
   assault, if it can be proved that he was a maniac at the time, he is
   acquitted, and all men approve the judicial decision which exempts him
   from punishment. Exercise of reason indispensable. Hence it is apparent
   that the exercise of reason is essential to moral agency. We may bring
   before our minds a thousand acts, under different circumstances, but
   all performed by agents without reason, and no man can believe that
   such actions are of a moral nature, or of good or ill desert.

   No objection lies, from the case of infants. It may seem to be an
   objection to this broad assertion that there are some who entertain the
   opinion that infants are moral agents from their birth, and commit
   actual sin. But these persons do not suppose that an irrational being
   can be a moral agent, but they think that infants have an obscure
   exercise of reason. Their mistake is not in the general principle which
   has been laid down, but in the fact that infants have reason in
   exercise.

   Another instance. Again, let the case supposed be varied. Let it be
   that the person committing the assault had the full exercise of reason,
   but that the stroke was not voluntary, but the effect of a spasmodic,
   diseased, action of the muscles; or that the hand was moved by another.
   Every one, at once, judges that the person giving the stroke, whatever
   he might be in other matters, was no moral agent in this assault. It
   was a mere physical operation, and not proceeding from the will, could
   not be a moral act. Voluntary action necessary. Here we have a second
   circumstance or characteristic, essential to moral agency, namely, that
   the action be voluntary. No involuntary action can be of a moral
   nature.

   Liberty and voluntariness. Some distinguish the liberty of the agent
   from voluntariness, but to us they appear to be the same, or to involve
   one another. If an act is voluntary, it is free; and if free, it must;
   be voluntary. The highest conceivable degree of liberty in a dependent
   being, is the power of doing as he wills or pleases. But as this
   subject has by metaphysical controversy been involved in perplexity,
   something may be said hereafter, respecting what is called the freedom
   of the will.

   Omission may be culpable. When it is said that the actions of moral
   agents are the only proper objects of moral approbation or
   disapprobation, two qualifications of the assertion must be taken into
   view. The first is, that the omission to act when duty calls, is as
   much an object of disapprobation as a wicked action. Should we see a
   number of persons sailing on a river in a boat, and while we surveyed
   them, should a child near them fall into the river, and no hand be
   stretched out to rescue it from drowning, we could not help feeling a
   strong disapprobation of the conduct of the persons who were near
   enough to render the necessary help. If, however, it should be
   ascertained that one or more of the persons were fast bound and
   pinioned, so that they could not possibly stretch out their hands to
   rescue the child, we should exempt them from all blame: for no man is
   bound to do what is physically impossible. Blame is referred to the
   intent. The second qualification of the statement is, that when we
   disapprove an external act, we always refer the blame to the motive or
   intention. But if we have evidence that the agent possesses a nature or
   disposition which will lead him often or uniformly to perpetrate the
   same act when the occasion shall occur, we not only censure the motive,
   but extend our moral disapprobation to the disposition or evil nature,
   lying behind.

   Acts under control. If we suppose the case of an agent acted on by a
   superior power, so that the nature and direction of the act depend not
   upon the agent himself, but upon the power by which he is governed, we
   shall consider the immediate agent as not free, and the acts brought
   forth, as not properly his acts, but those of the governing power. A
   demoniac or person possessed by an evil spirit who had power to direct
   his thoughts and govern his actions, would not be an accountable agent.

   Divine efficiency in human acts. There are some who maintain that all
   human actions proceed from God, as their first cause, and that man can
   act only as he is acted upon. Upon this theory, it does not appear how
   man can be an accountable moral agent; for though his actions may be
   voluntary, and performed in the exercise of reason, yet as he does not
   originate them, they can scarcely be considered his own.

   Moral faculty necessary to moral agency. We will now suppose the case
   of a man possessing reason, freedom, and will, and originating his own
   actions, but destitute of a moral faculty, or unable to perceive a
   difference between right and wrong. Can such a person be considered a
   moral agent? We think not. That being--how much soever of reason he may
   possess--who has no perception of moral relations, and no feeling of
   moral obligation, would be incapable of a moral law, or of performing
   moral acts. But the case is an imaginary one. There are, I believe,
   none, who possess reason, and yet are destitute of all moral sense; but
   though we conceive of the intellect of a dog or an elephant increased
   to any degree, yet, as being destitute of a moral faculty, we do not
   regard them as moral agents.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV.

  MAN A MORAL AGENT.

   The question stated. VERY few have entertained the opinion that man is
   a mere machine, governed by physical influences. It will not be
   necessary, therefore, to occupy time in refuting an opinion contrary to
   reason and universal experience.

   Fatalism. But there are many who entertain the opinion that man is the
   creature of necessity; that in the circumstances in which each man is
   placed, he could not be different from what he is. This theory of
   fatalism is plausible, because a slight observation of the history of
   man shows that the moral characters of most men are formed by the
   education which they receive, and by the sentiments and conduct of
   those with whom they associate. The theory of circumstances. It has,
   therefore, been maintained--and the opinion has in our day been
   industriously propagated--that man is not a free and accountable agent;
   that he is what he is, by the operation of causes over which he has no
   control; that no man should be censured or punished for his conduct,
   since those who censure him, if placed in the same circumstances, would
   act in the same manner. In short, that no man is responsible for his
   conduct; because his actions--whether good or bad--are the effect of
   necessary causes. It is held by the same persons that the only possible
   method of meliorating the condition of the human race, is to educate
   them in such a manner as to avoid those prejudices which have hitherto
   proved inimical to the happiness of men; Socialistic scheme. and to
   remodel society, rejecting those institutions which are supposed to
   cause most of the misery which is found in the world. This theory has
   not only been embraced with confidence, but attempts have been made to
   carry it out in practice. Societies founded on the principles above
   stated, have been formed both in Great Britain and America. But thus
   far the experiment has been attended with small success. Still the
   advocates of the Social system, as it is called, have not been
   discouraged. They are instituting new societies upon an improved plan,
   and the most sanguine hopes are entertained by those concerned in these
   new associations, that a far better and happier state of society than
   any hitherto enjoyed, is practicable and will be realized.

   Consciousness declares man free. In answer to all arguments brought to
   prove that man is not a free moral agent, we appeal to the
   consciousness of every rational being. No arguments, however plausible,
   are of any force against intuitive first principles. Whether we can or
   cannot answer arguments against liberty, we know that we are free. In
   regard to some actions, we feel that we are under a moral obligation to
   perform them, and in regard to others, that we ought not to perform
   them, and if we are induced to violate this obligation, we feel that we
   are to be blamed, and are deserving of punishment.

   This consciousness not deceptive. Some philosophers have been persuaded
   by their reasonings that man is not free, but under necessity in all
   his actions. But as they could not deny that every man is intimately
   conscious of being free, they have adopted the opinion that man's
   feeling of liberty is a deceptive feeling, and contrary to fact. A far
   more reasonable conclusion is that there must be some error in the
   reasoning from which the conclusion that man is not a free agent, is
   deduced. When a chain of reasoning brings us to conclusions repugnant
   to our intuitive convictions, it is certain that there is a flaw in
   some link of it, whether we can discover it or not. We are as certain
   that we are free, as we can be; a revelation from heaven could not
   render us more so. As in other instances where speculative men have
   been led to adopt conclusions at variance with self-evident principles,
   so here, men act, in common life, in conformity with the common notions
   of mankind. They can by no effort divest themselves of this assent to
   certain fundamental truths.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV.

  MAN NOT UNDER A FATAL NECESSITY.

   Arguments of Fatalism. ALTHOUGH our consciousness of freedom ought to
   satisfy us, whatever reasonings to the contrary may be adduced; yet it
   may be useful to inquire whether, indeed, there are any arguments of
   force against the free agency of man. It is certain that one truth
   cannot be in opposition to any other truth. If, therefore, the
   deductions of reason and the evident principles of common sense and
   experience seem to stand in opposition to one another, it must arise
   from some misapprehension, or abuse of terms. As our understanding is
   given us to enable us to apprehend truth, no proposition clearly
   perceived to be true, whether intuitively or by ratiocination, can
   possibly be opposed to any other truth.

   Notion of Liberty and Necessity. It becomes necessary, therefore, in
   the first place, to have distinct ideas of what is meant by liberty,
   and what by necessity. Here the reference must be not to metaphysical
   reasoning, but to the common judgment and clear conviction of all
   impartial men. It has already been stated that that liberty which is
   necessary to moral agency, can be nothing else than the liberty of
   doing what we will, to the extent of our power. It is freedom of action
   in conformity with our desire and will. When a man is compelled by
   force to strike another (I mean not by the force of strong motives, but
   by actual physical force), we say he is not accountable, because not
   free to do as he willed. When we think of that liberty which is
   necessary to free agency, and to the performance of a moral act, this
   is the kind of liberty which we have in our minds. In judging of the
   moral quality of an act, we never attempt to go further back than the
   spontaneous inclination of the mind, and never think it necessary to
   know in what way this disposition was acquired. If the action proceed
   from will, so far as liberty is concerned it is a moral act. We cannot
   conceive of any greater or more desirable liberty than this. Dependent
   creatures, indeed, cannot possess that independent liberty which is the
   prerogative of the Deity. The creature, notwithstanding his liberty, is
   still under the government of divine Providence.

   The necessity which precludes free agency. It is also important that we
   entertain distinct and accurate ideas of that necessity which is
   inconsistent with free agency. There is what has been termed moral or
   philosophical necessity, which is not incompatible with human liberty.
   This is no other than the certain operation of moral causes, producing
   moral effects, according to the power which they possess. Such
   necessity, it has been shown, must belong to God, because he cannot act
   in opposition to truth, wisdom, and justice. But this does not hinder
   him from acting freely. So the angels in heaven and glorified saints
   are so confirmed in holiness that they cannot sin; but still in loving
   and serving God they act most freely.

   Incorrect use of the term necessary. But as in the common use of terms,
   and according to the common apprehension of men, liberty and necessity
   are diametrically opposite; when the name necessity is applied to any
   exercise, the prejudice immediately arises that it cannot be free;
   especially if there be some points in which it coincides with real
   necessity. Here, it is probable, we have the true source of the
   difficulty and perplexity in which this subject has been involved. The
   word necessary should never have been applied to any exercises which
   are spontaneous or voluntary, because all such are free in their very
   nature. When we apply this term to them, although we may qualify it by
   calling it a moral or philosophical necessity, still the idea naturally
   and insensibly arises, that if necessary they cannot be free. It is
   highly important not to use a term out of its proper signification;
   especially when such consequences may arise from an ambiguous use. An
   event may be absolutely certain without being necessary. It was
   absolutely certain that God, in creating the world, would act most
   wisely. Certainty not necessity. It is a matter of absolute certainty
   that the holy angels will continue to love and serve God incessantly;
   but this certainty is not inconsistent with liberty. If a man possess
   good principles, and all temptation to do wrong be removed, it is
   morally certain that, in any given case, he will do right; and if a man
   be of corrupt principles, and all virtuous considerations be foreign
   from his thoughts, and strong temptations be presented to his ruling
   passion, it is certain that he will yield to temptation and commit sin.
   But in all these cases there is no necessity, because there is no
   coercion or compulsion. If the mere certainty of an event were
   inconsistent with freedom, then there could be no such thing as liberty
   in God or the creatures. As God knows all things most certainly, every
   thing, in his view, whatever may be its cause, is equally certain; the
   divine prescience cannot be mistaken. There is no good reason why
   uncertainty should be considered essential to that liberty which is
   necessary to moral actions. All causes operate according to their
   nature and force. The reason why one effect is necessary and another
   free is not that the one takes place without an adequate cause, or that
   the same cause may produce different effects; for both these are
   contrary to common sense. The true reason is that the one is produced
   against will, or without will, whereas the other is a voluntary act.

   Importance of the distinction. Let the distinction between what is
   certain and what is necessary be fully comprehended and attended to,
   and a great part of the darkness which, in the view of many, has
   obscured this subject will be dissipated. Although, then, it should be
   demonstrated that the will is as certainly governed by motives as the
   scale of the balance is by weights, yet there can be no legitimate
   inference from the one to the other, as if that would prove that the
   will is not free but under a necessity. The difference lies not in the
   difference of certainty in the two cases, but in the difference in the
   nature of the causes of that certainty.

CHAPTER XVI.

  MAN'S DIRECTION AND GOVERNMENT OF HIS ACTIONS, AND HIS CONSEQUENT
  RESPONSIBILITY.

   Extremes to be avoided. THERE are two extremes to be avoided here. The
   first is that which considers man as, in some sense, a passive
   recipient of influences from without. He is represented as placed in
   certain circumstances and surrounded by certain objects, in the
   selection of which he has had no choice; and as he is susceptible of
   certain impressions which these circumstances and objects are fitted to
   make upon him, he cannot be considered a free and accountable agent.

   The power really from within. In opposition to this false hypothesis we
   assert that the whole force which governs man is within, and proceeds
   from himself. External objects are in themselves inert. They exert no
   influence; no power emanates from them. The only power and influence
   which they can possibly have over any man they derive from the active
   principles of his nature. We are, indeed, accustomed in popular
   language to say that external objects excite and inflame the mind; but
   in philosophical accuracy they are, but the passive objects on which
   the affections and desires of the mind fasten, and their whole power of
   moving to action depends upon the strength of the inward affections of
   the soul. To render this perfectly plain to every mind, it will only be
   necessary to attend to a few familiar illustrations.

   No force in outward objects. To a man who is under the influence of
   hunger or thirst, bread and water are said, when seen, greatly to
   excite him, so that he is strongly impelled to appropriate these
   objects to the craving wants of his nature. But every one sees at once
   that both the bread and the water are merely passive objects on which
   the appetite fixes. the real force which impels to action, is not,
   therefore the external object, but the inward desire which is in the
   soul itself. For where no appetite of hunger or thirst exists, the
   bread and water, however presented and urged upon the. sense, produce
   no effect; there is no motive to action experienced.

   Force resides in internal principles. Take another case. A man comes
   into a room where lies a pile of gold. Avarice urges him to seize the
   beloved object, and appropriate it to himself. Two desires or motives
   counteract the tendency of avarice; one is a sense of duty or regard to
   the dictate of conscience, which he knows ought to be obeyed; the other
   is a regard to reputation, or the good opinion of men. Between these
   two antagonistical principles, there must of course be a conflict. If
   avarice be strong, and the power of conscience and desire of the good
   opinion of men be comparatively weak, the consequence will be that the
   man will put forth his hand and take the gold, and at the same time
   will feel conscious that he is doing wrong. But if conscience be fully
   awake, and especially if a love of moral excellence and a hatred of
   iniquity have a place in his mind, this motive alone will be sufficient
   to induce him to reject at once the thought of appropriating what
   belongs to another. In this case it is evident that the gold on the
   table is altogether passive; there is no secret emanation from the
   inert metal. The whole power of gold to seduce the mind to evil depends
   on the strength of the principle of avarice within; and in a mind
   rightly constituted, or under the influence of good. moral
   dispositions, it could never so prevail as to induce the person to do
   an unlawful act for the sake of obtaining it.

   Externals are only objects. From these cases it is evident that a man
   is not governed by any influence from without or separate from himself,
   but that the true spring of his actions lies entirely in his own
   inclinations and will, external things having no other influence than
   as they furnish objects suited to his appetites and other desires.

   Motives not separate existences. Some writers on the will, in speaking
   of the governing power of motives, have expressed themselves in a
   manner which leads to the opinion that the motives by which the will is
   determined exist without us, or separate from ourselves, whereas those
   motives which possess an active power and govern our voluntary actions,
   are within us, and are our own active powers and affections, for which
   we are as responsible as for any other acts or operations of the mind.
   Hence it may truly be affirmed that every man possesses a
   self-determining power by which he regulates and governs his own
   actions according to his own inclinations.

   Self-determining power. The other extreme in regard to this subject is,
   that the will possesses a self-determining power in itself, independent
   of all motives, and uninfluenced by any inclination. And it is
   maintained that such a self-determining power is essential to freedom,
   and to the existence of an accountable moral agent. If, indeed, this
   last opinion were correct we should admit the self-determining power of
   the will, whether we understood its nature or not; for we lay it down
   as a first principle--from which we can no more depart than from the
   consciousness of existence--that man is free; and therefore stand ready
   to embrace whatever is fairly included in the definition of freedom.
   But it is not yet made evident, or even probable, that such a power
   exists, or that it is at all necessary to free moral agency, or that
   the possession of such a power would be valuable or desirable.

   Not necessary. All that is wanted is to make man the master of his own
   actions, and this is completely effected by giving him the power to
   will and act in accordance with his own inclinations. Certainly a man
   is not the less accountable for his actions because they are in
   accordance with his desires. Every rational being acts with a view to
   some end, and his regard or affection for that end is the motive which
   governs his will and influences his conduct.

   Denial of such power does not conflict with liberty. It cannot be
   justly denied, and is generally admitted, that in most cases the
   determinations of the will are influenced by strong desires; and when
   such desires exist, and there are none leading a contrary way, the
   decisions of the will are in fact determined by the previous state of
   the mind. Now if the prevalence of these desires in such cases is not
   found to interfere with free agency, there is no reason to think that
   the belief that the will is invariably determined by the strongest
   existing desire will lead to any conclusion unfavourable to liberty. If
   the self-determining power in question is exerted only in trivial cases
   where motives to action are weak, or when there is an equipoise of
   motives, it cannot be a power of any great consequence, since most of
   our moral acts are performed without its aid.

   Instances examined. Let us first take an impartial view of the acts of
   a man in the exercise of the power which all admit he possesses, and
   then of this imaginary power which some think essential to moral
   agency.

   First case. In the first case the man exercising his reason, apprehends
   objects which appear to him, on some account, good and desirable. These
   objects he desires to obtain, and puts forth those volitions which
   produce the actions requisite to the accomplishment of his object.

   Second case. In the second case the man feels an inclination leading
   him with more or less force to a certain object; but he has a power
   which he can at any time exert to arrest his action in the line of his
   inclinations, and by exerting this power of willing he can counteract
   any desire, and act in opposition to it. Or if two desires exist, he
   can by this power give the prevalence to that which is the weaker. The
   best way to bring this matter to the test of experience is to suppose a
   case in which such a power is exerted. Suppose the case of a man in
   whom, by habit and indulgence, the appetite for intoxicating drink is
   strong; but he is induced by weighty reasons derived from a sense of
   duty and a regard to his health, reputation, family, and temporal
   prosperity, to determine not to expose himself to temptation. An old
   companion calls and solicits him to go with him to a convivial meeting.
   His appetite strongly pleads for indulgence, if only for this one time;
   but conscience remonstrates, and a regard to health, reputation, and
   the like, operates strongly on the other side. Suppose the influence
   felt from these two opposite sources to be almost equally balanced;
   suppose even a perfect equipoise. Such a state of mind, though possible
   and frequently experienced, can never last long, for the states of the
   mind change in some respects every moment, and the least difference in
   the views of the subject would destroy the balance. But now is the time
   for the exercise of the power which determines without regard to
   motive. Suppose, while the scales are thus in equipoise, this power to
   be exerted, and the man determines in favour of self-denial. Why he did
   thus determine, seems to be a reasonable inquiry; but if this power
   exists, such a question is entirely irrelative. There was, according to
   the supposition, no reason or motive which influenced the
   determination. Here then is a case for our consideration: Is an action
   prompted by no motive, and performed without a view to any end, an
   accountable moral act? If this self-determining power exists, it may be
   exerted in opposition to the highest and best motives, and neither the
   person himself nor any body else can tell why it was exerted. If a man
   under the influence of love to his Creator, should be about to engage
   in the performance of some plain and important duty, the exertion of
   this power at the most unseasonable time might arrest his action and
   lead him to a contrary determination. Why would he exert such a power
   at such a time? That, indeed, is the question. No power to determine
   against all motives. But if any reason of any kind could be given it
   would destroy the hypothesis, which is that a man has power to
   determine in opposition to all existing motives, and where there is a
   competition can act in conformity with the weakest. Surely such a power
   is irrational and dangerous in the extreme, and has no tendency to
   increase that freedom which is requisite to a moral agent.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII.

  OBJECTIONS TO THE UNIFORM INFLUENCE OF MOTIVES.

   Objection from regret at wrong actions. ONE of the most plausible
   objections to the uniform influence of motives on the will is, the
   intimate conviction every man has, when he has done what he regrets,
   that he could have done otherwise; whereas, upon the hypothesis laid
   down above, the man could not possibly, with the same motives, have
   acted differently from what he did. And it is alleged that no man ever
   would or could repent of his most criminal conduct, were he persuaded
   that he could not have willed and acted differently from what he did.

   The true question stated. This objection brings out the true issue in
   this inquiry. The real question in dispute in regard to the will is,
   whether, all things external and internal being the same to any
   voluntary agent, the volitions will be the same. That is, whether a man
   in the same state of mind and under the influence of the same desires
   and motives, in kind and degree, will not always will and act in the
   same way. This we affirm; and the advocates of the self-determining
   power of the will, deny.

   Analysis of the alleged conviction. It is admitted that when a man has
   done wrong and is convinced of his error, he is deeply conscious that
   he might and should have acted differently. But when this conviction is
   analyzed, it is found to be, not that he might have willed and acted
   differently with the same feelings that influenced him at the moment of
   doing wrong, but that he might and should have had a different state of
   feeling, or a more considerate attention to those things which were
   forgotten, but which if recollected would have prevented him from doing
   that which he now regrets.

   Example. Take a case. A man in an hour of levity, and under the
   influence of a degree of envy, speaks disrespectfully of a person whose
   character is worthy of esteem, and to whom he is under special
   obligation. Upon reflection he is truly sorry for what he said,
   candidly confesses his fault, and says that were he again placed in
   similar circumstances, he would not be guilty of the same fault. But
   suppose he should be asked whether, if the same degree of inattention,
   and the same envious feeling should again exist which characterized the
   state of his mind when he spoke unadvisedly, and no considerations
   should occur which were not then present to his mind, he is of opinion
   that he would act differently from what he did. Under such a view of
   the matter, few persons dare profess that they would act differently
   when placed in precisely the same circumstances. When we feel that we
   would and could act differently from what we have done in certain
   specified circumstances, it is always on the supposition that our views
   and feelings should be different. If the person speaking
   disrespectfully of a friend is asked what would induce him to act
   differently, if the thing were to be done again, the natural and
   reasonable answer is, "I should think of the impropriety of the thing,
   and should recollect my obligations to the person; and other the like
   considerations." This shows that men feel accountable, not only for
   their volitions and actions, but for the views and feelings which
   precede volition. Indeed if there is one point above all others on
   which responsibility rests, it is on the motives, that is, the active
   desires or affections of the mind from which volition proceeds, and by
   which it is governed. The murderer could easily abstain from murder, if
   he would repress his malignant feelings; but with the same spirit of
   malice and revenge which induced him to shed his brother's blood, and
   with the same absence of all other views and feelings than those which
   he had at the time, there is a moral certainty that he would commit the
   same crime again. Nor has this certainty, that unrestrained malice and
   revenge would again lead to the perpetration of the same horrid crime,
   the slightest tendency to alleviate the guilt of the murderer. The true
   ground of his culpability, lies in his having and indulging such
   malignant tempers, and in voluntarily turning away his mind from all
   considerations of piety and humanity, which would restrain him from the
   cruel act. And here a question might arise respecting a man's desires
   and affections, and the power which he has over them; but this is not
   the proper place for a discussion of that point.

   Objection from impossibility of choosing between equals. Another
   objection which has been repeatedly urged, and which by many is
   considered unanswerable, is, that according to this hypothesis, when
   two things exactly equal, and viewed to be so, are presented to the
   choice of a rational being, it would be impossible to choose either.
   But every man (say the objectors) feels that he has the power, if two
   loaves of bread or two eggs exactly alike be presented, of choosing
   between them; and as there exists confessedly no motive for preferring
   one loaf or one egg to the other, therefore it is possible for the will
   to determine without a motive.

   Answer. To this plausible objection it may be answered, that if the
   self-determining power of the will, independent of motives, be confined
   to cases in which there are no motives to turn the balance, it is a
   power of very little importance, and not worth disputing about. Let it
   be admitted that in such an equipoise of motives, the mind can
   determine in favour of either of the objects. But perhaps this will
   admit of a different solution, and one in accordance with the theory
   maintained. And let it be remarked, that it is not the similarity of
   external objects which should here be considered, but the view which
   the mind takes of them. We know how a fertile imagination may cast a
   grain into one of the balanced scales, and cause it to preponderate.
   But. further, the state of mind supposed to be produced by objects of
   equal value, is really felt for a moment. Between two things we
   hesitate, not being able to come to a decision,; but this indecision
   arises not from a belief that the objects proposed are equal, but from
   a doubt which is preferable. When we are sure there is no difference,
   this hesitation is not experienced. The explanation which seems
   correct, is the following: two guineas are laid before a poor man, and
   he is told to take which one he pleases. It cannot be necessary that he
   should think one better than the other. If such a preference were
   necessary, he would be unable to take either, and his situation would
   be comparable to the ass of the old Greek sophists, held immovable
   between two bundles of hay.

   The difficulty unknown in fact. The difficulty supposed to exist in the
   case of two equal objects proposed for our choice, is perfectly
   imaginary: no difficulty or perplexity is ever experienced, when the
   things presented to our choice are known to be equal. It is only when
   we apprehend that there may be a difference between the objects
   offered, that we hesitate. As if a person should offer to our choice
   two caskets, the contents of which are unknown; we find it difficult to
   choose, for the very reason that we suspect the one to be more valuable
   than the other, but are ignorant to which the greatest value attaches.
   And if we should be informed that one contained jewels of great price
   and the other nothing but baubles, our hesitancy would be accompanied
   with solicitude. But when we are certain that the things proposed to
   our choice are perfectly alike, in all respects, we experience no
   difficulty whatever. Suppose it to be first a single guinea which is
   offered to a needy beggar; he is moved by his feeling of want to take
   it. If instead of one, two guineas are offered, he experiences no
   difficulty in choosing, knowing them to be alike. But this furnishes no
   example of an action produced without a motive. The question is,
   whether the man shall act or not; and the motive for action is strong,
   namely, the desire of relief. As he is at liberty to take but one, and
   there is no difference between them, he seizes that, which from one or
   more of a thousand slight reasons of nearness or convenience, it
   happens to him to choose, without any preference properly so called.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII.

  SUMMARY VIEW OF LIBERTY.

   Man intuitively certain that he is free. MAN is conscious of liberty,
   and nothing can add to the certainty which h e h as that he is a free
   agent. Objections to self-evident principles, however plausible, should
   not be regarded; for, in the nature of things, no reasonings can
   overthrow plain intuitive truths, as no reasonings can be founded on
   principles more certain. Though we may not be able to understand or
   explain with precision wherein freedom consists, yet this ignorance of
   its nature should not disturb our minds. We experience the same
   difficulty ill regard to other truths of this class without any
   diminution of our assurance. I am conscious that I have life--but what
   is life? neither I nor any other human being can tell. But do we,
   because of this ignorance, doubt whether indeed we live? Not in the
   least. We know that we are free precisely in the same manner that we
   know that we are living beings, and no plausible reasonings should
   disturb us in the one case more than in the other.

   This certainty undisturbed by errors of reasoning. Again, if in
   attempting to explain what is essential to free agency, we should fall
   into any mistake, or conclude that some thing does not belong to it,
   which does, let it not be said that we deny the freedom of man; for
   while we may err in regard to our conception of its nature, we know
   that we cannot err in regard to the actual existence of freedom.

   Reason for denying some demands. We are willing to attribute to man
   every kind and degree of liberty which can properly belong to a
   dependent creature and a rational being; and if we deny what some think
   essential to free agency, it is because in our view it would be no real
   privilege to possess such a power, as not being compatible with the
   laws by which rational creatures are governed.

   Postulates. It is admitted that man has power to govern his own
   volitions, and does govern them, according to his own desire. He has
   the liberty, within the limits of his power, to act as he pleases; and
   greater liberty, in our judgment, is inconceivable.

   Liberty is not power to act independently of all reasons. To suppose,
   in addition to this, a power to act independently of all reasons and
   motives, would be to confer on him a power for the exercise of which he
   could never be accountable. It would be a faculty which would
   completely disqualify him from being the subject of moral government.
   In the nature of things, it would be impossible that a creature
   possessed of such a power could be so governed that his actions could
   be directed to any end.

   First hypothesis. One hypothesis makes man the master of his own
   actions, but a creature governed by understanding and choice. He may be
   misled by false appearances, and influenced by wrong motives, but is
   always governed by some reasons or motives.

   Second hypothesis. On the other hypothesis a man may and does act
   without any inducement, and without being influenced by any reasons, to
   do what is contrary to all his inclinations and feeling. I cannot but
   think that, after all, the abettors of this scheme retain in their
   minds a certain obscure but lingering persuasion that the free agent
   feels some reason for acting as he does; and if so, the dispute is at
   an end, for whatever may be the consideration which induces a man to
   act in opposition to strong desires, it must be something which is felt
   by the mind to have force, and to be such a consideration as ought to
   influence a rational being.

   Let us for still further elucidation again suppose a case in which this
   self-determining power is exerted.

   Case supposed for self-determining power. A young man entrusted with
   the property of his employer, has by undue indulgence in amusements,
   contracted debts which he is unable to pay. He sees a way by which he
   can appropriate to his own use some of the money in his hands without
   the possibility of discovery. His wants are urgent, his reputation is
   at stake, and he feels himself impelled by a powerful motive to the
   deed; and there are no motives to draw him in an opposite course but
   such as are derived from conscience and the fear of God. At the moment
   when about to perpetrate the felonious act, he pauses and resolves that
   he will not do it. The question is, has he not power to act thus? Is he
   not the arbiter of his own acts of will? Are we not all conscious that
   we possess such a power? There is no dispute about the power, if it
   only pleases the agent to exercise it. He is as free to abstain from
   embezzling what belongs to another, as to do it. The only question is,
   will he do it unless some reason, motive, or moral feeling influence
   him? If so, then indeed it would be the exemplification of the power in
   question. But when we examine the case carefully we shall be satisfied
   that where there is a powerful motive on one side, there must be a
   preponderating motive on the other to prevent a volition in accordance
   with the first. Suppose the young man under the temptation mentioned to
   have his mind free from all moral considerations, and to have no fear
   of injuring his reputation, what would restrain him? Or, if without any
   moral influence, or any other consideration, he should abstain, would
   there be any virtue in the act? To know whether an act is virtuous, we
   properly ask, why was it done? what was the motive of the agent? But
   here there is none, and consequently the act can have no moral
   character. And if we suppose some faint remonstrance of conscience, and
   some slight fear of discovery, even these would not prevent the act
   where the contrary motives were urgent.

   But suppose, now, this young man to have had a religious education, and
   to have been brought up to regard his reputation, and when the
   temptation is most powerful and he is in danger of yielding, conscience
   should utter her voice with power, and dictate imperatively that this
   is a deed which should not be done; and at the same time, a lively
   apprehension of disgrace should operate with a combined influence on
   his mind, would the operation of these motives in preventing the crime
   be less rational or less virtuous than if he should act without a
   motive?
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIX.

  THE KIND OF INDIFFERENCE WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL TO FREE AGENCY.

   Acts of choice are free. IN every act of choice or will, it is implied
   that the person willing might, if he pleased, act in a different way
   from what he does, for otherwise he would be under a necessity of
   acting in one way only, and there could be no freedom in such an
   action. There is no freedom in the pulsations of the heart, for they
   are not voluntary, but go on whether we will it or not. Liberty of
   contradiction and of contrariety. In all actions where the will is
   exercised there must be at least two things which may be done. This
   liberty was by the ancients distinguished into two kinds, the liberty
   of contradiction, and the liberty of contrariety. In the first we have
   the choice of doing or not doing some proposed act. In the second, we
   have the liberty to do one thing or another, or one thing or several
   others. In regard to such objects of choice, there was said to be
   indifference, by which it was not meant that the mind was indifferent
   at the moment of choice. This would be a contradiction, because
   indifference towards an object, and the choice of an object, are
   opposite and irreconcilable states of mind. But the meaning was, that,
   abstractly from the feelings of the agent, the contrary or different
   actions were indifferent. It was in the power of the agent, if he were
   disposed, to do or not do, to do this or that; but it was never
   understood to imply, that with the inclination in one direction a
   choice might be made in the opposite direction. A man may do what he
   pleases, but it is absurd to suppose that he can will to do what it
   does not please him to do.

   Power of contrary choice. The doctrine of a power of contrary choice,
   as the thing has been now explained, is a reasonable doctrine, and in
   accordance with all experience, if with the volition you include the
   motive, if with the choice you take in the desire. Volition cannot
   contravene prevalent inclination. But to suppose a volition contrary to
   the prevailing inclination is in consistent with all experience; and,
   as has been shown, such a liberty or power would disqualify a man for
   being an accountable moral agent.

   Theory of Abp. King. In the last century an able metaphysical writer,
   convinced that the common doctrine of the self-determining power of the
   will could not stand, invented a new hypothesis. His leading idea is,
   that we do not choose an object because we desire it, but desire it
   because we choose it. According to this view of Archbishop King, in his
   work on the "Origin of Evil," there must be a state of absolute
   indifference prior to an act of choice; for all love or attachment to
   an object, and all desire of possessing it, are produced by the act of
   the mind in choosing it. This is a complete inversion in the order of
   the exercises of the mind. Though recommended by high authority, and
   ingeniously defended by its author, it seems strange that it should
   have found any respectable abettors. Adopted by Watts. But Dr. Watts,
   in his Essay on the "Freedom of the will in God and the creatures,"
   adopts the outlines of the Archbishop's scheme, and defends its
   principles by many arguments. This led President Edwards, in his
   celebrated work on the Will, to take particular pains to refute this
   false theory. Refuted by Edwards. The indifference of which he treats
   is that which appertains to this scheme. Many, however, have been led,
   from an acquaintance with the work of Edwards, to suppose that the
   doctrine of indifference, as refuted by this great man, is common to
   all who maintain the opinion of the self-determining power of the will;
   which is far from being the case.

   It is deemed unnecessary to give a refutation of this theory in this
   place. Those who wish to see this effectually done may consult the
   several sections of the work of Edwards, to which reference has been
   made. [2]

CHAPTER XX.

  WHETHER MEN ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MOTIVES; OR WHETHER DESIRES AND
  AFFECTIONS WHICH PRE CEDE VOLITION, HAVE A MORAL CHARACTER.

   Maxims which seem conflicting. THERE are two maxims on this point,
   which we must endeavour to reconcile, as there is an apparent
   repugnance between them.

   1. The motive gives character to the act. 2. The act is voluntary. The
   first is, that every action takes its character from the motive from
   which it proceeds. The second is, that every moral act is voluntary,
   and therefore, that desires and feelings which precede volition, cannot
   be of a moral nature. This difficulty seems to have perplexed the
   perspicacious mind of Chalmers; Dr. Chalmers for, perceiving that our
   desires and affections do possess a moral character, he labours,
   through a number of pages, to prove that, in as far as they are such,
   they are influenced by the will. The truth, however, is, that many of
   them are uninfluenced by preceding volition, and the whole reasoning of
   the learned author is unsatisfactory. The true solution is to be found
   in the ambiguity of language. When it is asserted that all moral
   actions are voluntary, the meaning is, either that by actions only
   external actions are meant, or that under the word voluntary, the
   affections of the mind which precede volition are included. No act of
   the body can take place without an action of the will preceding it; so
   that the maxim is true, as it relates to external acts. But it is also
   true in relation to mental acts, if we give a certain degree of
   extension to the word "voluntary," that is, if we use it as synonymous
   with spontaneous. Our desires are as free and spontaneous as our
   volitions, and when it is said that every moral act must be voluntary,
   the word is used in this comprehensive sense. There is no need,
   therefore, to prove that our affections must have received their
   complexion from a preceding volition. The judgment of the moral faculty
   in regard to the moral character of the desires and affections, is as
   clear and undoubted as of the volitions. Nay, the volitions receive
   their moral character from the quality of the motives which produce
   them; so that the very same volition may be good or bad, according to
   the moral character of the motives by which it is produced. The
   volition requisite in order to pull a trigger and let off a gun, is the
   same, let the motive be what it may. It is a determination to perform
   that specific act, and if it be performed by an insane person, there
   will be no morality in the volition. If the same volition be put forth
   by a person acting in his just defence, the volition and ensuing act
   will be good; but if the volition to shoot a man, arise from malice or
   avarice, the volition prompting the act will be wicked.

   We must go higher than volition. We do not, therefore, trace actions to
   their true moral source when we ascertain the volition from which they
   proceed; we must always go one step higher, and ascertain the motives.

   Motives must be sought. When an investigation is made into the
   character of an act of which some one is accused, the main point, which
   by witnesses the court and jury wish to ascertain, is, from what
   motives the accused acted. Accordingly as this is determined, so is he
   judged to be innocent or guilty. It hence appears, that the true and
   ultimate source of the morality of actions, is not found in the will,
   but in the desires and affections. The simple act of volition, namely,
   a determination to do a certain act, is always the same, whatever be
   the motive. And to ascertain that an action proceeds from an act of
   will, only determines that it is the act of a particular agent, but
   gives us no knowledge respecting the true moral quality of the act.
   This will be found universally true. Two men are seen giving money to
   the poor; the acts are the same, and the volitions preceding the acts
   and prompting them, are the same; and as we cannot see the heart, we
   naturally judge that both acts are alike good. But if it should be
   revealed to us, that one of the persons was influenced entirely by a
   love for the praise of men, and the other, by a sincere regard for the
   welfare of the poor, we should immediately make a wide difference
   between the acts, in our moral judgment. We should still be convinced,
   however, that the volitions leading to the acts were the same, the only
   difference being in the motives.

   Man accountable for his motives. It is clear then that men are more
   accountable for their motives than for any thing else; and that,
   primarily, morality consists in the motives; that, is the affections.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXI.

  THE DIVISION OF MOTIVES, INTO RATIONAL AND ANIMAL.

   Reid's distinction. DR. THOMAS REID, in his work on the Active Powers,
   endeavours to maintain his doctrine that the will is not always
   governed by motives, by a reference to a certain distinction. Animal
   motives act by a blind impulse on the will, without regard to remote
   consequences. Rational motives operate by the force of reasonable
   considerations. Dr. Reid asserts that these classes of motives are so
   widely different, that their influence can never be compared: that what
   may be the strongest of one class, may be the weakest of the other, and
   that the mind must determine between them.

   The difference real. The distinction is no doubt just. There are
   principles in the human constitution, which act on the will with great
   force, by a blind impulse. Such are the appetites and passions, and the
   desire of happiness, and especially the desire to escape pungent pain,
   at present experienced.

   Appetite. The appetite of hunger urges the subject of it to eat,
   whether it can be done lawfully and consistently with health, or not.
   This influence is sensibly present, and it requires some strength of
   purpose to resist it, when the agent is convinced that the act cannot
   be done with propriety. Here then is the simultaneous operation of an
   animal and a rational motive; and it is evident that they counteract
   each other, and that according to the strength of one or the other, the
   will is determined this way or that way. Whether the two can be
   compared. It is not true, therefore, that these different kinds of
   motives cannot be compared as to their effective force. The fact is,
   they are brought into comparison every day, and every day victories are
   obtained by one over the other, according to the strength or influence
   which they respectively possess, at the moment. Hunger impels a man to
   eat; reason tells him that it will be injurious to health. Here is a
   fair trial of strength between the force of blind appetite, and a
   rational regard for health. If the appetite be very strong, it will
   require a strong resolution to oppose it. In such cases, however,
   appetite commonly prevails; but not without resistance. In every case
   of the kind, there is a trial of strength between these different
   motives. Case of hunger and self-preservation. Suppose food to be
   placed before a hungry man; if there be no considerations of duty or
   utility to prevent, he will of course indulge his appetite. But if he
   should be informed that the food is poisoned, although he be still
   impelled by his appetite to eat, yet the love of life or fear of death,
   will be sufficient to induce him to refrain.

   Case of hunger and duty. Suppose, again, that the food is the property
   of another, whose consent to use it cannot be obtained. Here the moral
   feelings stand in the way of indulgence; and upon the comparative
   strength of his appetite and of the vigour of his conscience, will
   depend his determination. So far is it from being true, then, that
   animal and rational motives cannot be compared, in regard to their
   influence on the will, that there is nothing in human life more common
   than the experience of the struggle for mastery between the higher and
   lower principles of our nature.

   The determination accords with prevalent desires. When it is said that
   the mind determines between these contending motives, it is true, but
   not in the sense intended. It is true that the mind determines, and of
   course the volition is on one side or the other; but this determination
   is not independent of the strength of the contending motives, being
   always in accordance with the strongest existing desires.

   The difference of the two. There is this important difference between
   animal and rational motives, that a sensible impulse of the former as
   merely felt, is not of a moral nature. The hunger of a man is no more
   moral than the hunger of a beast. These animal feelings are unavoidable
   and constitutional. The point at which such feelings begin to partake
   of a moral quality, is when they require to be governed and directed.
   It was not wrong for the hungry man when he saw bread before him to
   desire it. But when he knew it to be the property of another, it would
   have been wrong to take it; and when he knew that the food would injure
   him, it became his duty to forbear.

   We cannot extinguish the animal feelings by an act of the will; they
   arise involuntarily, and therefore cannot be in themselves of a moral
   nature. Yet as man has other principles and powers by which he should
   be governed, he becomes faulty when he neglects to govern these lower
   propensities in accordance with the dictates of reason and conscience.
   But in regard to other desires and affections, they are good or bad in
   every degree in which they exist. For example, not only are malice and
   envy sinful when ripened into act, but the smallest conceivable
   exercise of such feelings is evil; and as they increase in strength,
   their moral evil in creases. It does not require an act of volition,
   consenting to these feelings, to render them evil; their very essence
   is evil, and is condemned by the moral sense of mankind.

   Concupiscence. A clear understanding of this distinction might have
   prevented or reconciled an old dispute, viz. whether concupiscence [3]
   was of the nature of sin, in the first rising of desire, prior to any
   act of the will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] It may remove ambiguity to say that the word concupiscence is here
   used not in its popular and modern, but its theological acceptation.
   The controversy to which allusion is made began early in the schools,
   and was actively waged at the time of the Reformation. The following

CHAPTER XXII.

  WHETHER MORALITY BELONGS TO PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS ACTS, OR IS CONFINED TO ACTS
  ALONE.

   Moral principles prior to volition. IT seems to be generally agreed,
   that in the human soul there exist certain principles from which
   actions proceed, as streams from a fountain; and that the character of
   the actions corresponds with that of the principle. Those, however, who
   maintain that the will possesses a self-determining power, independent
   of motives, deny the existence of any such principles lying back of the
   acts of the mind, especially in moral exercises. They hold that the
   evil of an act arises entirely from the exercise of free will, and that
   there is no propriety in referring it to any thing previously existing
   in the mind. They allege that nothing can be of a moral nature but that
   which is voluntary, and therefore that virtue or vice can be predicated
   of nothing but actions. They argue, however, that to make virtue and
   vice consist in the occult qualities of the soul, is to conceive of the
   essence of the soul as corrupt; and that this would be to make sin a
   physical quality, existing without any relation to the will. It would
   be entirely out of place, here, to consider the bearing of this
   controversy on certain theological points, concerning which polemics
   have waged an interminable war. We have, at present, nothing to do with
   any principles or questions but such as may be learned from reason and
   experience.

   Principles argued from effects. In the first place, let it be observed,
   that we know nothing of the soul but by its acts. We have no
   consciousness of any thing but acts of different kinds; yet we know as
   certainly that we have a soul, as that we think and feel. So, also, we
   are not conscious of the existence of what is called disposition,
   temper, principle; but we as intuitively believe in the existence of
   these, as in the existence of the soul itself. If we see one man doing
   evil whenever he has the temptation, and another as habitually doing
   good, we cannot help considering that the one is actuated by an evil
   disposition which dwells in him, and that the other is influenced by a
   good disposition.

   Morality predicable of principles. Whether moral good and evil may with
   propriety be predicated of these hidden tempers of the mind, must be
   determined by an appeal to the common judgment of mankind; and this, I
   think, is manifestly in favour of the affirmative. When a man is
   observed to manifest wicked, malignant passions as often as occasion
   serves to elicit them, all men agree that he possesses a malignant
   temper. The soul of such a man, when his acts of iniquity are finished,
   cannot be free from every taint, until he again put forth a voluntary
   act. The doctrine of a uniform series of evil acts, is irreconcilable
   with the doctrine that all evil consists in self-determined acts,
   unless the will itself be corrupt, for why should all acts be of one
   kind, when no cause exists why they should be one thing rather than
   another? We might suppose such a power would act as frequently one way
   as another. But if there be any causes without the will, which give a
   uniform character to its acts, then the will cannot be free. It is
   determined by something without itself, which is incompatible with the
   hypothesis.

   Moral evil predicable of principles. Again: the fountain must partake
   of the quality of the streams. If these are uniformly evil, it is fair
   to conclude that the fountain is polluted. Voluntary wickedness is
   nothing else but bringing into act what before existed in principle in
   the soul. If malice in act is sinful, surely malice in principle must
   be evil.

   Crime infer a bad principle. No man can bring himself to believe that
   the wretch who has perpetrated thousands of base crimes, and stands
   ready to commit others of the same kind, has no evil inherent in his
   soul, by which he is distinguished from the most innocent person.

   Proof from omission of duty. Another evidence that men do judge
   something to be sinful besides sinful acts, is that men who palpably
   omit important duty, are considered equally guilty with those who
   offend by positive act. That man who neglects to rescue from death a
   human being, when it is easily in his power to do so, is by all men
   reckoned guilty of a great crime, though he performs no act of any
   kind. Suppose a helpless woman or infant to fall overboard from a boat,
   in which there is a strong man who might afford relief, but makes no
   attempt to do so. Is there a person in the world who would not view
   such a neglect as a great sin? Now, on what principle do we censure the
   person who has committed no act of transgression? Evidently on the
   ground that he ought to have felt a regard for the life of a
   fellow-creature. We blame his indifference to the welfare of his
   neighbour.

   Disposition, in what sense voluntary. As to the maxim, that nothing is
   sinful which is not voluntary, it relates to positive acts, not to
   dispositions of the mind. But as was explained before in regard to
   desires and affections, so in regard to dispositions, we say they are
   in a sense voluntary. They properly belong to the will, taking the word
   in a large sense. In judging of the morality of voluntary acts, the
   principle from which they proceed is always included in our view, and
   comes in for its full share of the blame. Thus Bishop Butler, in his
   excellent essay on the "Nature of Virtue," says, in speaking of the
   moral faculty, "It ought to be observed that the object of this faculty
   is actions, comprehending under that name active or practical
   principles." This sagacious man saw that it would not do to confine
   virtue to positive acts, but that principles must come in for their
   full share of approbation or disapprobation.

   Proof from character. The character which a man acquires by a series of
   acts, is not merely the estimation of a person who has performed such
   acts, but it is of a person possessing dispositions or principles which
   gave rise to such acts. Our notion of a bad man is of one who not only
   has perpetrated wicked acts, but is still disposed to do the same; and
   we disapprove the principle as much as the acts. The notion that
   corrupt principles must vitiate the essence of the soul, is without
   foundation. The soul is the subject of many affections which are not
   essential to it. Natural affections may be extirpated, and yet the soul
   remain unchanged. Moral qualities may be entirely changed, without any
   change in the essence of the soul. The faculties remain, while the
   moral principles which govern them may be changed from good to bad, or
   from bad to good. The same faculties which are employed in the
   performance of virtuous actions, may be occupied as instruments of
   wickedness. That inherent moral qualities may exist in the soul, has
   been the belief of all nations, and is the sentiment of every common
   man whose judgment has not been warped by false philosophy.

   Common judgment of mankind. Who can believe that the soul of a cruel
   murderer, whose heart cherishes habitual hatred and revenge towards his
   fellow creatures, is, when asleep, or occupied with indifferent
   matters, in the same state of purity or exemption from evil, as the
   soul of the most virtuous man in the world? It cannot be believed. We
   cannot help thinking, when we see a uniform course of action whether it
   be good or bad, that there must be corresponding dispositions which
   lead to such actions. Every effect must have an adequate cause. Let it
   be granted, for the sake of argument, that the self-determining power
   is an adequate cause for any single act of any kind; yet it can be no
   sufficient cause for a series of acts of the same kind. This, however,
   must be left to the intuitive belief of every man. It is a subject for
   the judgment of common sense, rather than reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIII.

  MORAL HABITS.

   Habits. HABITS differ from principles, or constitutional desires, in
   that they are adventitious. Every habit is acquired by repeated acts.
   The human constitution possesses a wonderful susceptibility of forming
   habits of every kind. Indeed, we cannot prevent the formation of habits
   of some kind or other. Still, a man has much in his power as it regards
   the kind of habits which he forms, and is highly accountable for the
   exercise of this power. A man's happiness and usefulness depend very
   much on the character of his habits. Yea, a man's moral character
   derives its complexion, in a great degree, from his habits. In this
   place, it is not necessary to go into the philosophy of the formation
   of habits. Our object is to consider habits and habitual actions as
   they partake of a moral character, or as they are the object of moral
   approbation, or disapprobation. If we should remove from the list of
   moral actions all those which are prompted by habit, we should cut off
   the larger number of those which men have agreed in judging to be of a
   moral nature.

   Accountability for habits. That there are virtuous habits and vicious
   habits, will scarcely be denied by any considerate person. A habit of
   lying, of swearing, of slandering, of cheating, of irreverence, of
   indolence, of vainglory, with many others, are, alas, too common. There
   are also virtuous habits, such as of industry, temperance, kindness,
   veracity, diligence, honesty, & c. To be sure, these virtues commonly
   flow from principle, but the practice of them is greatly facilitated by
   correct habits. Two considerations will show that men are properly
   accountable for those actions which proceed from habit. The first is,
   that in the formation of his habits, man is voluntary. The acts by
   which they are formed are free acts, and the agent is responsible for
   all their consequences. The other consideration is, that habits may be
   counteracted and even changed by the force of virtuous resolutions and
   perseverance. Where habit has become inveterate, it may be difficult to
   oppose or eradicate it; but the strength of moral principle has often
   been found sufficient to counteract the most confirmed habits. When it
   is asserted that men long enslaved by evil habits cannot make a change,
   it is on the ground, that no principle of sufficient power exists in
   the mind of the agent; but for that deficiency, the man is responsible.
   Yet a power from without may introduce a new principle potent enough,
   to overcome evil habits. The importance of possessing good habits, is
   admitted by all moralists. Aristotle makes the essence of virtue to
   consist in "practical habits, voluntary in their origin," and agreeable
   to right reason. Dr. Thomas Reid, in his "Essay on the Active Powers,"
   defines virtue to be "the fixed purpose to act according to a sense of
   duty," which definition Dugald Stewart modifies, by observing, "It is
   the fixed purpose to do what is right, which evidently constitutes what
   we call a virtuous disposition. But it appears to me that virtue,
   considered as an attribute of character, is more properly defined by
   the habit which the fixed purpose gradually forms than by the fixed
   purpose itself." Dr. Paley lays it down as an aphorism, that "mankind
   act more from habit than reflection." "We are," says he, "for the most
   part, determined at once, and by an impulse which has the effect and
   energy of a pre-established habit." To the objection, "If we are in so
   great a degree passive under our habits, where is the exercise of
   virtue, or the guilt of vice?" he answers, "in the forming and
   contracting of these habits." "And hence," says he, "results a rule of
   considerable importance, viz, that many things are to be done and
   abstained from, solely for the sake of habit."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIV.

  THE NATURE OF VIRTUE.

   Various theories. THE theories on this subject have been numerous, and
   contrary to one another. It is now proposed to mention some of the
   principal of them. We shall first mention the theory of Mr. Hobbes and
   his followers, Hobbes. who deny that there is any natural distinction
   between virtue and vice, and maintain that by nature all actions are
   indifferent, and that our ideas and feelings on the subject of morality
   are altogether the effect of education and association. Mr. Hobbes did
   indeed maintain that men are bound to obey the civil government under
   which they may happen to live, and to conform to the religion
   established by law, however contrary to their own private judgment. Law
   of the land. All moral duty, according to this theory, was resolved
   into the authority of the law of the land. As no natural moral rule
   existed, it was held that, except so far as a man was restrained by
   civil authority, he had a right to do what he pleased; and while he
   confined himself within these bounds, he need feel no concern about the
   consequences of his conduct.

   Mandeville. Perhaps the most extraordinary system of virtue ever
   promulgated was that of Mandeville, who maintained that all pretensions
   to virtue were mere hypocrisy, which men assumed from the love of
   praise. The defect of the hypothesis. This writer forgot that hypocrisy
   assumes it as true that that which is counterfeited is an object of
   esteem and approbation among men. That virtue consists in the mere
   pursuit of pleasure, or of our own interest, is a system as old as
   Epicurus, Epicurus. and has had many abettors up to this time. The
   arguments in favour of this theory are exhibited in their most
   plausible dress by Nettleton in his "Treatise on Virtue."

   The Happiness theory considered. But the whole plausibility of the
   arguments depends on the pre-established connexion between happiness
   and a virtuous course of life. That true happiness is the natural
   effect of virtue, falls entirely short of proof that the essence of
   virtue consists in the tendency of certain actions to the person's true
   interest; whereas, when we perceive an action to be virtuous, we are
   conscious that it is not from any view of the connexion of the action
   with our own happiness that we approve it; but our judgment is
   immediate, founded on a moral character perceived in the act itself.
   And in many cases virtue requires us to deny ourselves personal
   gratification for the sake of others. A man supremely governed by a
   regard to his own interest, is never esteemed a virtuous man by the
   impartial judgment of mankind. According to this theory, the only thing
   censurable in the greatest crimes is, that the guilty person has
   mistaken the best method of promoting his own happiness. Upon this
   principle a man is at liberty to pursue his own interest at the expense
   of the happiness of thousands, and if he is persuaded that any action
   will tend to his own interest, he is at liberty to do it, whatever may
   be the consequences to others.

   Archdeacon Paley. Dr. Paley adopts the principle that all virtue
   consists in a regard to our own happiness, taking into view the whole
   of our existence. His definition is, however, a very complicated one,
   and deserves to be analyzed.

   Paley's definition of virtue. "Virtue," says he, "is the doing good to
   mankind, in obedience to the will of God, for the sake of everlasting
   happiness," according to which definition the good of mankind is the
   object, the will of God the rule, and everlasting happiness the motive
   of human virtue. If the question be asked, why we should seek the good
   of mankind, the answer is, from a regard to our everlasting happiness;
   and if the question be, why we should make the will of God the rule of
   our conduct, the answer must be the same; so that really all virtue is
   resolved into a regard to our own happiness.

   Consequent difference between a good and a bad man. Now every man
   desires to promote his own happiness, and according to Dr. Paley's
   theory, the only difference between an eminently good man and one of
   the opposite character is, that the one pursues a wiser course than the
   other; but they are both actuated by the same motives.

   Neglects intrinsic moral differences. This theory loses sight of all
   intrinsic difference between moral good and evil, and admits the
   principle that happiness is the only conceivable good, and that any
   thing is virtuous the tendency of which is to promote our greatest
   happiness.

   Cumberland. A theory the opposite of that which makes a regard to
   private interest the ground of virtue, is the one which makes all
   virtue to consist in a regard to the public good. This is the theory of
   Bishop Cumberland in his work, De Legibus, and is not essentially
   different from the scheme of those who make all virtue to consist in
   disinterested benevolence. Disinterested benevolence. No doubt, much
   that deserves the name of virtue consists in good will to others, and
   in contributing to their welfare; but it is not correct to confine all
   virtuous actions to the exercise of benevolence. We can conceive of
   benevolence in a being who has no moral constitution. Something of this
   kind is observable in brute animals, and atheists may exercise
   benevolence to their friends. The indiscriminate exercise of
   benevolence to creatures, without any respect to their moral character,
   might appear to be an amiable attribute, but it could not properly be
   called a moral attribute. Regard for one's own welfare. A prudent
   regard to our own welfare and happiness is undoubtedly a virtue. It has
   been considered so by the wisest of men, and we know that prudence was
   one of the four cardinal virtues of the heathen. As the whole is made
   up of parts, it is evident that if it is a virtue to promote the
   well-being of the whole, it must be so of each of the parts. The
   pursuit of our own happiness where it does not infringe on the rights
   of others, has nothing evil in it, but is approved by every impartial
   mind. Some who maintain that all virtue consists in benevolence, admit
   that we may seek our own happiness just as we seek that of our
   neighbour; but the human constitution is not formed to exercise that
   abstract impartiality. Abstract impartiality not to be expected. While
   we are bound to promote the welfare of our neighbour and of strangers,
   our obligation is still stronger to endeavour to secure our own
   happiness; and if a friend and a stranger stand in equal need of a
   benefit which we have it in our power to bestow, it is evidently our
   duty to consult first the welfare of our friend, other things being
   equal.

   Butler's remarks on the disinterested scheme. What Bishop Butler has
   said on this subject in his short treatise on "Virtue," is worthy of
   consideration: "It deserves to be considered whether men are more at
   liberty, in point of morals, to make themselves miserable without
   reason, than to make others so; or dissolutely to neglect their own
   greater good for the sake of a present lesser gratification, than they
   are to neglect the good of others whom nature has committed to their
   care. It should seem that a due concern about our own interest or
   happiness, and a reasonable endeavour to secure and promote it, is, I
   think, very much the meaning of the word prudence in our language--it
   should seem that this is virtue, and the contrary behaviour faulty and
   blamable; since in the calmest way of reflection, we approve of the
   first and condemn the other conduct, both in ourselves and others. This
   approbation and disapprobation are altogether different from mere
   desires of our own and their happiness, and from sorrow in missing it."

   Benevolence not the whole of virtue. Again, "Without inquiring how far
   and in what sense virtue is resolvable into benevolence, and vice into
   the want of it, it may be proper to observe that benevolence and the
   want of it, singly considered, are in no sort the whole of virtue and
   vice. For if this were the case, in the review of one's own character,
   or that of others, our moral understanding and moral sense would be
   indifferent to every thing but the degrees in which benevolence
   prevailed, and the degrees in which it was wanting. That is, we should
   neither approve of benevolence to some persons rather than others, nor
   disapprove injustice and falsehood, upon any other account, than merely
   as an overbalance of happiness was foreseen likely to be produced by
   the first, and misery by the second. But now, on the contrary, suppose
   two men competitors for any thing whatever, which would be of equal
   advantage to each of them, though nothing indeed would be more
   impertinent than for a stranger to busy himself to get one of them
   preferred to the other, yet such endeavour would be virtue, in behalf
   of a friend or benefactor, abstracted from all consideration of distant
   consequences; as that examples of gratitude and friendship, would be of
   general good to the world. Again, suppose one man should by fraud or
   violence take from another the fruit of his labour, with intent to give
   it to a third, who, he thought, would have as much pleasure from it as
   would balance the pleasure which the first possessor would have had in
   the enjoyment and his vexation in the loss; suppose that no bad
   consequences would follow, yet such an action would surely be vicious.
   Nay further, were treachery, violence and injustice, no otherwise
   vicious than as foreseen likely to produce an overbalance of misery to
   society, then, if in any ease, a man could procure to himself as great
   advantage by an act of injustice as the whole foreseen inconvenience
   likely to be brought upon others by it would amount to, such a piece of
   injustice would not be faulty or vicious at all." "The fact then
   appears to be, that we are constituted so as to condemn falsehood,
   unprovoked violence, and injustice, and to approve of benevolence to
   some rather than others, abstracted from all consideration of which
   conduct is likely to produce an overbalance of happiness or misery."

   Defective definitions of virtue are dangerous. The danger of this
   theory is not by any means so great as that of the selfish scheme, be
   cause it comprehends a large part of actions which are truly virtuous.
   But all definitions of virtue which are not so comprehensive as to
   embrace the whole of moral excellence, are injurious; not only by
   leaving out of the catalogue of virtues such actions as properly belong
   to it, but by leaving men to form wrong conceptions of what is right
   and wrong, by applying a general rule, which is not correct, to
   practical cases. When it is received as a maxim that all virtue
   consists in seeking the happiness of the whole, and when a particular
   act seems to have that tendency, men are in danger of overlooking those
   moral distinctions by which our duty should be regulated. This effect
   has been observed in persons much given to theorize upon the general
   good as the end to be aimed at in all actions.

   Edwards on Virtue. President Edwards has a treatise on Virtue, in which
   he enters very deeply into speculation on the principles of moral
   conduct. His definition of virtue has surprised all his admirers: it
   is, "the love of being as such." When, however, this strange definition
   comes to be explained, by himself and his followers, it amounts to the
   same as that which we have been considering, which makes all virtue to
   consist in disinterested benevolence.

   Hopkins. Dr. Samuel Hopkins, who was his pupil, and well understood his
   principles, gives this as his definition of virtue, and has it as a
   radical principle of his whole system. It will not therefore be
   necessary to make remarks on President Edwards's theory.

CHAPTER XXV.

  THE NATURE OF VIRTUE, CONTINUED. DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES.

   Aristotle. ARISTOTLE'S idea of the nature of virtue was that it was a
   mean between two extremes. Virtue, according to him, consisted in the
   moderate and just exercise of all the affections and passions; and
   vice, in defect or excess. It would be easy to show that this
   definition or description is not complete. It is not sufficiently
   comprehensive, and includes many things not of a moral nature. But it
   is unnecessary to dwell on the subject, as the definition is no longer
   used.

   Clarke. Dr. Samuel Clarke, who has a long established character as a
   profound thinker, attempted to give a theory of virtue, which should be
   free from exception. He makes virtue to consist in acting according to
   the fitness of things. Whatever is fit and suitable to be done, taking
   in all circumstances, is right. But really, this gives us no conception
   of that peculiarity which renders an action virtuous. It is true, all
   virtuous actions are fit to be done, and are actions suitable to the
   circumstances of the agent. But every fit action is not a virtuous
   action, and the fitness of many actions depends on their moral
   character. Their fitness, therefore, does not render them virtuous, but
   their being virtuous is the very thing which renders them fit.

   Wollaston. Wollaston, in his "Religion of Nature Delineated," refines
   upon this system, and makes all virtue to consist in a conformity to
   truth. A virtuous action is one in accordance with the truth of things;
   which when it comes to be explained, amounts to much the same as Dr.
   Clarke's "fitness of things." Both of them include, no doubt, all
   virtuous actions, as they are all fit, and all in accordance with
   truth; but these definitions do not lead us to a conception of that
   quality in actions which is moral. Certainly all virtuous actions must
   be in accordance with truth and reason, but this is no definition of
   the nature of virtue; it is only a circuitous method of saying that
   some actions are virtuous because they have a fitness to produce a good
   end. This theory supposes the idea of virtue already to exist; for if
   the end be not good, mere fitness cannot be of the nature of virtue.
   There are other things which have a fitness to produce certain ends, as
   well as virtue. It is not mere fitness which renders an action
   virtuous, but adaptedness to a good end. And unless by truth we
   understand the same as virtue, it does not appear that a mere
   conformity to truth gives any conception of a moral quality, and there
   is as much reality in a vicious action as in one that is virtuous. On
   this subject Dr. Thomas Brown well observes, "Reason, then, as
   distinguishing the conformity or unconformity of actions with the
   fitness of things, or the moral truth or falsehood of actions, is not
   the principle from which we derive our moral sentiments. These very
   sentiments, on the contrary, are necessary, before we can feel that
   moral fitness or moral truth, according to which we are said to
   estimate actions as right or wrong. All actions, virtuous and vicious,
   have a tendency or fitness of one sort or other; and every action which
   the benevolent or malevolent perform, with a view to a certain end, may
   alike have a fitness for producing that end. There is not an action,
   then, which may not be in conformity with the fitness of things; and if
   the feelings of exclusive approbation and disapprobation, that
   constitute our moral emotions, be not presupposed, in spite of the
   thousand fitnesses which reason may have shown us, all actions must be
   morally indifferent. They are not thus indifferent because the ends to
   which reason shows certain actions to be suitable, are ends which we
   have previously felt to be worthy of our moral choice; and we are
   virtuous in conforming our actions to these ends, not because our
   actions have a physical relation to the end, as the wheels and pulleys
   of a machine have to the motion which is to result from them; but
   because the desire of producing this very end, has a relation, which
   has been previously felt, to our moral emotion. The moral truth, in
   like manner, which reason is said to show us, consists in the agreement
   of our actions with a certain frame of mind which nature has previously
   distinguished to us as virtuous, without which previous distinction,
   the actions of the most ferocious tyrant, and of the most generous and
   intrepid patriot, would be equally true, as alike indicative of the
   real nature of the oppressor of a nation, and of the assertor and
   guardian of its rights." The fitness and the truth, then, in every
   case, presuppose virtue as an object of moral sentiment.

   Adam Smith. The system of Dr. Adam Smith, contained in his "Theory of
   Moral Sentiments," is very plausible, as stated by its ingenious
   author, and has captivated many minds, by leading them to believe that
   the origin of our moral feelings is to be found in the principle of
   sympathy. According to this able writer, we do not feel the approbation
   or disapprobation, immediately on the contemplation of virtuous or
   vicious actions. It is necessary first to go through another process,
   by which we enter into the feelings of the agent, and of those to whom
   the actions are related, in their consequences, beneficial or
   injurious. If, on considering all the circumstances in which the agent
   was placed, we feel a complete sympathy with the feelings by which he
   was actuated, and with the gratitude or resentment of him who was the
   object of the action, we approve of the action as right; or disapprove
   it as wrong, if our sympathies are of the opposite kind. Our sense of
   the propriety of the action depends on our sympathy with the agent, and
   our sense of the merit of the agent, on our sympathy with the object of
   the action. In sympathizing with the gratitude of others, we regard the
   agent as worthy of reward; in sympathizing with the resentment of
   others, we regard him as worthy of punishment. When we judge of our own
   conduct, the foregoing process is in some measure reversed; or rather,
   by a process still more refined, we imagine others sympathizing with
   us, and sympathize with their sympathy. We consider how our conduct
   would appear to an impartial spectator; we approve of it if we feel
   that he would approve; we disapprove it if we think that he would
   disapprove. According to Dr. Smith, we are able to form a judgment as
   to our own conduct, because we have previously judged of the moral
   conduct of others; that is, have sympathized with the feelings of
   others. And but for the supposed presence of some impartial spectator,
   as a mirror to represent us to ourselves, we should as little have
   known the beauty or deformity of our own moral character, as we should
   have known the beauty or ugliness of our own features without some
   mirror to reflect them to our eye.

   The hypothesis fanciful. That a principle so irregular and capricious
   as that of sympathy should be made the origin of all our moral
   distinctions and feelings, is indeed wonderful. One might be tempted to
   suspect that the gifted author intended to select a subject merely for
   the display of his ingenuity in framing and defending a plausible
   hypothesis, and playing on the credulity of his readers.

   Untenable. The great error of this hypothesis is one which is common to
   most others on this subject: it takes for granted the existence of
   those moral feelings which are supposed to flow from sympathy--yea,
   their existence previous to that very sympathy in which they are said
   to originate. When we suppose this previous moral feeling, it is easy
   to understand how we are led to approve of actions when we feel
   sympathy with the agent; but the most complete sympathy of feeling is
   not sufficient to account for the existence of moral approbation or
   disapprobation. When there is nothing more than a sympathy of feelings,
   without the previous moral sentiment, no such exercise as that which
   Dr. Smith supposes could ever arise; so that the process which he
   describes as originating our moral sentiments, never could take place,
   unless there existed previously a moral feeling in the mind. Assumes
   what is sought to be explained. In contemplating the beauties of nature
   or art, we may have a complete feeling of sympathy with another person,
   our feelings may be in the most exact accordance, and yet no moral
   approbation of his sentiment of the beautiful be experienced. But if
   mere agreement in our emotions would give rise to moral feeling, it
   ought to arise vividly in this case, where the emotions may be strong
   and ill perfect accordance. "Why is it," says Dr. Brown, "that we
   regard emotions which do not harmonize with our own, not merely as
   unlike to ours, but as morally improper? It must surely be because we
   regard our emotions which differ from them as proper. And if we regard
   our own emotions as proper before we can judge the emotions which do
   not harmonize with them to be improper on that account, what influence
   can the supposed sympathy and comparison have had in giving birth to
   that moral sentiment which preceded the comparison? The sympathy,
   therefore, on which the feeling of propriety is said to depend, assumes
   the previous belief of that very propriety. Or, if there be no previous
   belief of the moral suitableness of our own emotions, there can be no
   reason from the mere dissonance of other emotions with ours to regard
   these dissonant emotions as morally un suitable in the circumstances in
   which they have arisen."

   Inadequate and defective. The theory of Dr. Smith not only includes the
   sympathy which we feel with the agent of an action, but also with the
   feelings of gratitude or resentment in the object of the action, as it
   may affect others with benefit or injury. If we feel that in similar
   circumstances our emotions would sympathize with theirs, we regard the
   agent in the same light in which they regard him as worthy of regard in
   one case, and of punishment in the other; that is, as having moral
   merit or demerit. It is evident that this is an inadequate and
   defective account of merit and demerit; for it confines these qualities
   to actions which relate to the welfare of others; but all impartial men
   judge that actions of a different kind may have merit or demerit. If a
   man, from a sincere desire of improvement in virtue, is led to deny
   himself habitually such gratification of his senses and appetites as
   would interfere with his progress, and to submit to a course of
   discipline to overcome evil habits, which is both difficult and
   painful, and yet perseveres in the midst of numerous temptations to
   relax, until he has obtained a complete victory over himself; who would
   say that there is nothing in all this to call forth moral approbation?
   But the actions have no respect to the happiness of others; there is no
   gratitude or resentment with which the observer can sympathize.

   Theory of conformity to the will of God. That theory which considers
   conformity to the will of God to be virtue, is undoubtedly correct; for
   that faculty in us which approves of virtuous actions was implanted by
   Him, and is an induction of his will. As soon as we get the idea of a
   God we cannot but feel that it is the duty of all creatures to be
   conformed to his will. But if the question be whether, in judging an
   action to be virtuous, it is necessary to consider distinctly of its
   conformity to the will of God, we are of opinion that this conception
   is not necessary to enable us to perceive that certain actions are
   morally good and others morally evil. In order to this judgment nothing
   is required but a knowledge of the circumstances and motives of the
   action. Even the atheist cannot avoid the conviction that particular
   actions are praiseworthy, and others deserving blame. Dictates of
   conscience strengthened by Theism. But though belief in the existence
   of God is not necessary to the exercise of the moral faculty, yet this
   belief adds great force to the dictates of conscience, and enables us
   to account for the existence of a faculty by which we discern qualities
   so opposite in the actions of moral agents. Indeed, to know that our
   conduct should be conformed to the will of God, supposes the existence
   of a moral faculty, of which this is one of the intuitive judgments. If
   we had no moral faculty, the obligation to be conformed to the will of
   God would not be felt. But intuitive moral perceptions have not this
   basis. It is true, undoubtedly, that it may be inferred from clear
   data, that ultimately all duty and all virtuous actions may be referred
   to the will of God as the standard by which they should be tried. Our
   original intuitive perception of the moral character of certain actions
   does not, however, take in this idea, but is an immediate judgment of
   the mind upon observing such actions. Morality is a quality seen in the
   actions themselves.

   Morality is presupposed. If the question be asked, why we should be
   conformed to the will of God? the answer is, because it is
   right,--morally right. We must then have a faculty of judging
   respecting moral obligation before we can know and feel that conformity
   to the will of God is right.

CHAPTER XXVI.

  THE NATURE OF VIRTUE. CONTINUED.

   Virtue. VIRTUE is a peculiar quality of certain actions of a moral
   agent, which quality is perceived by the moral faculty with which every
   man is endued; and the perception of which is accompanied by an emotion
   which is distinct from all other emotions, and is called moral. This
   quality being of a nature perfectly simple, does not admit of being
   logically defined, any more than the colour of the grass, the taste of
   honey, the odour of a rose, or the melody of tune.

   Vice. As some actions are morally good, which are virtuous; so there
   are other actions which are morally evil, or vicious. The perception of
   these, also, is accompanied by a feeling of a moral kind, The judgment
   immediate. but very different from that which accompanies the view of
   virtuous actions.

   Virtue, then, may be said to be that quality in certain actions which
   is perceived by a rational mind to be good; and vice, or sin, is that
   which a well-constituted and well-informed mind sees to be evil. The
   moral faculty necessary. Whatever may be the rule or standard of
   virtuous actions, the immediate judgment of the moral faculty on
   contemplating the act is necessary. Without a moral faculty we never
   could have the least idea of a moral quality, good or bad; therefore
   all actions must be brought before this faculty, and its judgment is
   ultimate. We can go no further. While the good or evil of some actions
   is self-evident, much discrimination and reasoning are requisite to
   arrive at a clear view of the true moral character of others. But the
   end of these processes is to bring the true nature of the action in
   question fairly before the mind, when it is judged by the moral
   faculty. Those actions, then, which a sound and well-informed mind
   judges to be morally good, are virtuous, and those which such a mind
   judges or feels to be evil, are sinful.

   The moral judgment is peculiar. As has already been explained when
   treating of conscience, the judgment of the mind respecting moral
   qualities, is the judgment of the understanding, and differs from other
   judgments only by the subject under consideration. The mind must
   possess the faculty of moral perception, of which all the inferior
   animals are destitute. To see that an action is useful, and will
   produce happiness to him that performs it, or to others, is one thing;
   but to perceive that it is morally good, is quite a distinct idea; and
   virtue and mere utility should never be confounded. It may be thought
   that this account of virtue makes the moral faculty the only standard
   of moral excellence. In one sense, this is true. It is impossible for
   us to judge any action to be virtuous, which does not approve itself
   when fairly contemplated by our moral sense. To suppose otherwise,
   would be to think that we had some other faculty by which to judge of
   moral actions than the moral faculty. Whether infallible. As no
   judgment of colours can be formed but by the eye, nor of sounds but by
   the ear, nor of odours and tastes out by the senses of smelling and
   tasting; so no judgment can be formed on moral subjects, but by the
   moral faculty. It may be asked, then, whether the judgments of this
   faculty are infallible, and if so, how it is that we have so many
   discrepant opinions, respecting the morality of actions. To which it
   may be answered, that when the mind is in a sound state, and any moral
   action is presented to it, with all the circumstances which belong to
   it, the judgment of this faculty is always correct and uniform in all
   men. As an eye in a sound state judges infallibly of colours, in which
   judgment all in precisely the same circumstances will agree in their
   perceptions; so it is in regard to moral qualities. If in looking at an
   object, one man has more light than another, or if one occupies a more
   favourable point of observation, the object will appear differently to
   the persons thus situated; but this does not argue that their eyes are
   differently constructed, or that there is any other faculty than the
   eye, by which the object may be surveyed. So, in regard to moral
   qualities, when they are presented to different minds with precisely
   the same evidence, the moral judgment will be the same. Discrepant
   judgments, whence. The differences observable in the dictates of the
   consciences of men, may be all traced to some cause which prevents the
   object from being perceived in its true light; such as ignorance,
   error, or prejudice. In regard to sin and duty, the ultimate appeal
   must be to conscience. We may bring considerations of various kinds to
   bear on the conscience, or to enlighten the mind, so that the moral
   faculty may be rightly guided; but still our ultimate rule must be the
   judgments of our own moral faculty.

   New relations occasion views of new duties. And here it may be
   remarked, that con science will recognise every new relation into which
   a moral agent enters, and will dictate the obligation to perform the
   duties obviously arising out of such relations. Or, if such an agent
   should for a time be ignorant of its relations, and afterwards discover
   them, it would, upon such discovery, feel an obligation not before
   experienced. Let us then suppose the case of a child educated in a
   cave, who, while the intellectual powers were cultivated, and the
   faculties developed, had never been informed respecting the existence
   of its parents and the relation it sustains to them. Of course, while
   in this state of ignorance, there would be no sense of obligation to
   them; but so soon as the nature of this relation should be clearly made
   known, the obligation to the obvious duties arising out of this
   relation, would immediately be felt. Let it be supposed, also, that
   this human being, until grown to maturity, had never heard of God, and
   of course possessed no idea of such a being. Duty of a creature as
   such. While in that state of ignorance, it could have no sense of the
   obligation to reverence, love and serve its Creator; but as soon as the
   mind should take in distinctly, the conception of God as the Author of
   its being, and as possessed of every adorable attribute, the duties
   arising out of this newly-discovered relation, would be felt to be
   obligatory. The will of God seen to be obligatory. A just consideration
   of this relation would lead to the conclusion that, in every thing, the
   will of such a Being, standing in such a relation to the creature,
   should be obeyed. Thus the important principle would be learned, that
   the will of God, so far as made known by reason or revelation, should
   be the supreme rule of moral conduct. Conscience, henceforth, would act
   under the influence of this truth. And making the will of God--so far
   as made known--the supreme and only rule of moral conduct, would not be
   found at all inconsistent with the obligation to obey the dictates of
   conscience; for it would now become evident that God, being the author
   of our minds, had constituted them with this moral faculty, to admonish
   them of duty, so that the dictates of an enlightened conscience are the
   clear indications of the law or will of God. It is the law written on
   the hearts of all men.

   Virtue predicable only of objects of moral approbation. Nothing can be
   considered as partaking of the nature of virtue which does not meet
   with the approbation of the moral faculty. This will by some be thought
   a dangerous principle, merely from a misapprehension of its nature.
   They allege that the will of God is the only perfect and immutable
   standard of moral rectitude. They allege, moreover, that to define
   virtue to be only such actions as the moral faculty in man approves, is
   to make it a very uncertain and fluctuating thing, depending on the
   variable and discrepant moral feelings of men.

   Answer to objection. This objection confounds two things which should
   be kept distinct, viz., the quality of an object and the light or
   medium through which it is viewed. The colour of an object can be
   perceived only by the eye; but in order to have the object fairly
   before the eye, there must be light reflected from it, and that light
   on entering the pupil, must be reflected so as to be conveyed to a
   focus on the retina. But without an eye it would be useless to descant
   ever so long or so learnedly on the nature of colours, or the laws by
   which light is reflected and refracted. In the case of sight, it is
   evident that all the perception which is experienced, must be by the
   eye. If the light is insufficient, it must be increased, and if any
   cause hinders it from being duly refracted, vision will not take place;
   but still, it is only by the eye that we can have any perception of
   colours.

   Analogy of taste. Perhaps an illustration, drawn from the faculty of
   taste, may be more appropriate. A beautiful landscape is presented; I
   am charmed with its beauty. This emotion or feeling of the beautiful
   depends on the faculty of taste. If that were absent, I might see all
   the objects as they stand, and perceive nothing of the beautiful.
   Beauty in the works of nature or art can be perceived only by taste,
   and the emotion will depend on the perfection of the faculty, provided
   the object is presented in a favourable light. A person of cultivated
   taste sees beauties where a rude savage sees none. Thus also in regard
   to moral acts, or a connected series of moral actions, every idea and
   feeling of a moral kind must as necessarily be through the moral
   faculty as colours through the organ of vision. We have no other
   faculty which takes cognizance of moral qualities. The judgments and
   emotions which are produced by the contemplation of such actions, are
   always infallibly correct, when the mind is duly enlightened and the
   faculty itself in a sound and healthy state. There is no inconsistency
   between this opinion and that which considers the will of God as the
   real standard and ultimate rule of moral conduct.

   Moral feelings dependent on the dictates of understanding. For, as has
   been shown, although conscience can act within a narrow sphere without
   even the knowledge or belief of a God; yet so soon as this knowledge is
   obtained, and the mind recognises its relation to its Creator, a new
   field is opened for the operations of conscience. It is soon perceived
   that the clear dictates of conscience, in cases of self-evident truth,
   are nothing else than the indication of the law of God written on the
   heart of every man, as was before taught. We can refer to the will of
   God as a rule of moral conduct no other way than by the exercise of the
   moral faculty, by which it is clearly perceived that our Creator and
   Preserver has a just claim on our obedience, and ought in all things to
   be obeyed. But if conscience did not thus dictate, all appeals to the
   will of God, to show what is morally right, would be in vain. The
   certainty and immutability of our moral standard of rectitude will then
   be in proportion to the knowledge which the mind possesses of the
   existence of God and the creature's relation to Him. Instead,
   therefore, of making our moral feelings mere instinctive emotions, as
   is done by Hutcheson and Shaftesbury, we make them depend on the clear
   dictates of the understanding; for, as we have often explained, the
   judgments of conscience are no other than the understanding judging on
   moral subjects.

   Evil of attempting undue simpification. If that, and that alone is
   virtue, which is approved by a mind duly enlightened, and in a sound
   state, then the attempt to reduce all virtuous actions to some one
   kind--as to benevolence, for example--is not the way to arrive at the
   truth. For while benevolent actions generally meet with the approbation
   of the moral faculty, we can easily conceive of an exercise of
   benevolence which, instead of being approved. would be viewed as
   morally indifferent, or merely amiable--as a natural affection, or even
   as evil. We never ascribe morality to the kind feeling of brutes to one
   another. The natural affection of parents, called storge by the Greeks,
   is no more of a moral nature than the same affection in inferior
   animals. The natural affection of our relatives, our neighbours, and
   countrymen, is amiable and useful, but not of a moral character. If a
   judge should feel a strong benevolence toward all criminals, so as to
   avoid inflicting on them the penalty of the wholesome laws of the
   country, we should judge it wicked. It might be said that a benevolence
   which counteracts a greater good, is not virtuous but sinful; yet it is
   an exercise of benevolence, and serves, on the concession of those who
   make all virtue to consist in benevolence, to show that all benevolence
   is not virtue, which is the very thing to be proved. Again, there are
   acts of moral agents, which have nothing of the nature of benevolence,
   yet which the moral faculty judges to be morally good. For example, if
   a man for the sake of moral improvement, denies himself some
   gratification which would in itself be pleasing to nature, we judge
   such self-denial to be virtuous.

   Prudence a Virtue. A thousand acts of prudence which have regard to our
   own best interests, without interfering with the interest of others,
   have always been reckoned virtuous. Indeed, among the ancient sages,
   prudence was one of the four cardinal virtues. The attempt, therefore,
   to reduce all virtue to the simple exercise of benevolence, must be
   unsuccessful. It is so evident that some actions which have our own
   welfare as their object, are virtuous, that rather than give up their
   theory that all virtue consists in benevolence, they enlarge the
   meaning of the word, so as to make it include a due regard to our own
   welfare. But this is really to acknowledge that al] virtue does not
   consist in benevolence, according to the usual meaning of that word.
   Any term may be made to stand for the whole of virtue, if you choose to
   impose an arbitrary meaning upon it. Benevolent affections, however, is
   a phrase which has as fixed and definite a meaning as any in the
   language, and by all good writers is used for good will to others.
   Benevolent affections are, therefore, constantly distinguished from
   such as are selfish. If, however, any one chooses, contrary to
   universal usage, to employ the words in a sense so comprehensive as to
   include self-love, be it so. We will not dispute with such a one, about
   the meaning of the word, provided he agree that the judicious pursuit
   of our own improvement and happiness is virtuous.

   Actions to be classified. To determine how many different kinds of
   actions are virtuous, we must pass them in review before the moral
   faculty, and then classify them; being in the whole process governed by
   the light of true knowledge, and taking into view all the relations in
   which the human race, or any portion of it, is placed. Something of
   this kind we may attempt in the sequel of this work; in which we shall
   endeavour to survey the moral duties incumbent on men, in their various
   relations.

CHAPTER XXVII.

  WHETHER VIRTUE AND VICE BELONG ONLY TO ACTIONS.

   Moral acts are complex. IT has repeatedly been brought into view that
   moral qualities are found only in actions of moral agents, and not in
   all actions, but only in those performed under certain circumstances.
   But when we consider those actions which are of a moral nature, we find
   that they are complex, consisting of an external and internal part. At
   once we can determine that a mere external or corporeal action can
   possess no morality, except as connected with the internal or mental
   exercise which produced it, and of which it is the exponent. But here
   again there are several acts of the mind clearly distinguishable from
   one another, and it is of importance to determine in which of these the
   moral quality exists. On this subject there is a diversity of opinion.
   It seems commonly to be taken for granted, that the act bf volition is,
   so to speak, the responsible act, and this has led to the maxim almost
   universally current, that "no action is of a moral nature which is not
   voluntary." Moral acts voluntary. Accordingly, writers of great
   eminence have entertained the opinion, that to render our desires and
   affections moral, they must directly or indirectly proceed from
   volition. But here arises a serious difficulty. Our desires and
   affections are not subject to our volitions. Desires not subject to
   volition. We may will with all our energy to love an object now odious,
   and our will produces no manner of effect; except to show us our
   inability to change our affections by the force of the will. On the
   contrary, we find by constant experience that our volitions are
   influenced uniformly by our prevailing desires. No man ever put forth a
   volition which was not the effect of some desire, feeling, or
   inclination. Now, after the most attentive examination of our minds, we
   find that certain affections which are neither produced by volitions
   nor terminate in volitions, are, in the judgment of all reflecting men,
   of a moral nature. Yet desires have moral quality. For example, envy at
   the prosperity of a neighbour is not the result of any volition, and it
   may be cherished inwardly without leading to any volition, the will
   being controlled by other feelings which prevent action; yet all must
   admit it to be a morally evil disposition. The truth then appears to
   be, that our affections are properly the subject of moral qualities,
   good and evil. Whence volition has its quality. Volitions take their
   character entirely from the internal affections or desires from which
   they proceed. The volition, viewed abstractly, is always the same, when
   the external action is the same; but the moral character of the acts,
   where the volitions are the same, may vary exceedingly. If I will to
   strike a man with a deadly weapon, the simple volition which precedes
   and is the immediate cause of the action, is the same whether I give
   the stroke in self-defence, in execution of the law, or through malice
   prepense. Indeed, the volition of an insane person to strike a blow is
   exactly similar to the volition of a sane person striking a similar
   blow. Hence it is evident that the proper seat of moral qualities is
   not in the will, considered as distinct from the affections, but in the
   affections themselves, which give character to the volition as much as
   to the external action. The true spring of actions. These internal
   affections or desires are properly the springs of our actions, and our
   wills are the executive power by which they are carried into effect.
   They are commonly called motives, and very properly, as they move us to
   action; Motives. but I have avoided the use of that word, because it is
   ambiguous, and has occasioned much misconception on this subject. By
   motives, many understand reasons or external qualities in the objects
   of our desires; that which excites or moves our affections. Then when
   it is asserted that the will is governed by the strongest motives, some
   understand the meaning to be the strongest reasons, or those qualities
   in an object best adapted to excite our affections. In this sense the
   proposition is not true. Whether governed by the strongest reasons.
   Minds are often in such a state that they are not governed by that
   reason which in their own view is the strongest; that is, which in
   their better judgment seems wisest and best. And often our minds are
   not influenced or governed by those external objects or considerations
   which in the judgment of impartial reason are most weighty. In what
   sense will follows the strongest motives. But if by motives be
   understood the desires themselves, actually in exercise at the time,
   however produced, then it may be truly said that the will is always
   determined by the strongest motives, that is, the strongest desires.
   But even this proposition needs qualification. The strongest single
   desire does not always govern the man, but the strongest combination of
   desires, as may be thus exemplified. A man in returning from a journey
   on a cold day has a strong desire to reach home without delay; but
   passing a house where he knows he can enjoy a warm fire, and good
   refreshment, and the company of a friend, though his desire to reach
   home is stronger than his de. sire to see his friend, stronger than his
   desire to enjoy the fire, or his desire for food or drink, yet all
   these combined prove sufficient to induce him to stop.

   Morality of an act from its intention. It is often said that the
   intention or end for which an action is performed, determines its moral
   character; and as our desires always point to some object which is the
   end of the action, this account of the matter coincides with the view
   already given. As if a man gives money to another, though we see the
   action, and are sure that it was voluntary, yet that determines nothing
   respecting the moral character of the action. Before we can judge any
   thing correctly, we must know the intention with which the act was
   performed. If it was to pay a just debt, we approve it as a moral act,
   but of small merit. If it was to supply the wants of a poor suffering
   family, unable to help themselves, we still approve, but our
   approbation is much stronger; the act is more meritorious than the
   former. But if we are informed that the person on whom the benefit was
   conferred was an enemy who had sought every opportunity to injure him
   who is now his benefactor, we esteem it the highest degree of Christian
   virtue. But if it should appear that the money was given to a common
   drunkard, to enable him to procure intoxicating drink; though the
   external act and volition are the same, instead of approving the
   action, we censure it as culpable. And finally, if it should appear
   that the intention was to hire an assassin to murder an innocent
   person, and that person a benefactor, our emotion rises to the highest
   degree, and we reprobate the action as evil in the extreme. In all
   these cases, the action and the volition producing it, are the same.
   The only difference is in the end or intention with which it was done.
   The assertion qualified. The intention will serve to characterize
   actions very well, but is not comprehensive enough to take in all the
   exercises of mind which possess a moral character. I feel habitually a
   kind disposition to my fellow-creatures, but for much of my time I have
   not the opportunity of performing any particular acts of kindness. All
   impartial persons will say that this habitual feeling is of a virtuous
   character; but there is no intention in the case. It is merely a
   feeling which terminates in no volition or action.

   Intention not comprehensive enough. My neighbour, who has been a bad
   man, undergoes a real change of character, and from being profane and
   quarrelsome, becomes pious and peaceable. I rejoice in the change. This
   joy is a virtuous emotion, though it has no intention accompanying it.
   This will serve to show that making the intention the sole
   characteristic of morality, is correct in regard to actions, but is not
   comprehensive enough to take in the whole of morality.

   Objection. It may seem that in what has been said, we contravene the
   maxim, that all moral actions are voluntary, a maxim which has received
   the sanction of ages, and may be considered an intuitive principle:
   whereas it is now maintained that there are exercises of mind which do
   not involve any exercise of will; and that our volitions themselves
   have nothing of a moral nature but what they derive from the motives
   from which they proceed.

   The maxim admitted. The maxim, rightly understood, is no doubt just,
   and we should never affect the wisdom of being wiser than the common
   sense of mankind, where we meet with truths in which all men of sober
   reflection have been agreed. It is safer to take them for granted, as
   believing that universal consent in such matters furnishes the best
   evidence of truth.

   The objection removed. But the explanation is easy. The maxim applies
   primarily to actions, which must be voluntary to have the character of
   morality. If the action is not voluntary, it is not properly the action
   of the person who seems to perform it, for we can act in no other way
   than by the will.

   Ambiguity of term voluntary. But again, the word voluntary as employed
   in the maxim under consideration, includes more than volition; it
   comprehends all the spontaneous exercises of the mind; that is, all its
   affections and emotions. Formerly all these were included under the
   word will, and we still use language that requires this latitude in the
   construction of the term. Scholastic acceptation of Will. Thus it would
   be consonant to the best usage to say that man is perfectly voluntary
   in loving his friend or hating his enemy; but by this is not meant that
   these affections are the effect of volition, but only that they are the
   free spontaneous exercises of the mind. That all virtue consists in
   volition, is not true--as we have seen; but that all virtuous exercises
   are spontaneous, is undoubtedly correct. Our moral character radically
   consists in our feelings and desires. These being the spontaneous
   actings of certain latent principles or dispositions, this hidden
   disposition is also judged to be morally evil, because it is productive
   of such fruit. And of good dispositions we judge in like manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXVIII.

  THE AUTHOR OF OUR BEING CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO MORAL SCIENCE

   Preceding truths lead to argument for a Supreme Being. IT has already
   been intimated, that the very existence of conscience seems to
   indicate, that man has a Superior to whom he is amenable for his
   conduct. The feeling of moral obligation which accompanies every
   perception of right and wrong, seems to imply, that man is under law;
   for what is moral obligation but a moral law? And if we are under a law
   there must be a lawgiver, a moral governor, who has incorporated the
   elements of his law into our very constitution. This argument for the
   existence of God, is solid, and independent of all other arguments; and
   it goes further than arguments derived from the evidences of design;
   which abound in the world around us; for these prove no more than that
   the Author of our being is intelligent, but this argument proves that
   he is a moral Being, and exercises a moral government over us. The
   Atheist, when he feels, as he must, remorse for some great crime, can
   scarcely help believing, that there is a God who is displeased with his
   wicked conduct, and who will punish him hereafter; for the keen anguish
   of remorse seems to point to a punishment which is future. Hence it is
   that when Atheists come into those circumstances which have a tendency
   to awaken the conscience, they for the time become believers in the
   existence of God. Atheism practically recanted. Thus in a storm at sea,
   even the most confirmed Atheist has been found calling upon God, for
   deliverance; and when death is suddenly presented to them, they often
   find, that their atheistical theories cannot withstand the power of an
   awakened conscience. Certainly the existence of an accusing conscience
   cannot in any way be so well accounted for, as by the supposition that
   man is the creature of a Being who intended to form him in such a
   manner, that he should have a control over his actions, and who has
   left an indelible proof of his authority in the mind of every man.

   Argument against Atheism. But omitting to press this argument further
   at present, let us attend to some of the other evidences of the
   existence of a God. No one can contend that there is anything absurd in
   the idea of an eternal, all-powerful, intelligent, First Cause, from
   whom all things have received their being. No one can doubt that the
   supposition of the existence of such a Being seems to account for the
   phenomena of nature; and it is equally certain, that they cannot be
   rationally accounted for on any other hypothesis.

   Teleiologic argument. To deny that in animals and vegetables there are
   evident marks of design, would be as unreasonable as to deny that any
   thing exists. Thus the eye was formed to see, the ear to hear, the
   mouth to masticate our food, the stomach to digest it, the various
   internal organs to separate the particles suited for nutrition from the
   mass, and by a wonderful and inexplicable process to convert, or
   assimilate these particles into the various forms and organs which
   constitute the human body. For any man to affirm that in all these
   contrivances and operations, there is no evidence of design, is
   certainly to contradict the intimate conviction of his own reason. It
   may on many accounts be expedient and highly profitable, to accumulate
   arguments from design, as manifested in the rational, animal,
   vegetable, and mineral world; A few instances of design sufficient. but
   for mere argument and demonstration, these details are unnecessary. A
   man cast away on a desolate shore, would be as certain that some
   rational beings had been there, if he found one watch, or one quadrant,
   as if he should see a thousand of such like or other works of art,
   strewed along the shore. His mind is soon satisfied with the force of
   this evidence, as observed in a few particulars, and the conviction of
   the truth, that these things are the effect of a designing cause, is as
   perfect as it can be, by the contemplation of ever so many instances.
   It may, I think be taken for granted, and even Atheists will admit,
   that we cannot conceive of any works, or contrivances, which would more
   clearly evince design, than those which are found in the human, and
   other animal bodies. Chance. Though it is said that some ancient
   Atheists attributed every thing to chance, yet it seems unnecessary to
   take up much time in combating such a theory. Atheists no longer resort
   to this very absurd notion. As then design manifest in any effect,
   leads necessarily to the conclusion, that intelligence exists in the
   cause; there is no escape from the conclusion, that the cause of the
   existence of animals and vegetables is a wise and powerful Being, but
   by one of the following suppositions. 1. That every thing in which
   design is manifest, has existed from eternity; or, 2. That there are in
   the material universe, causes possessing power and intelligence to
   produce these effects, but no one great intelligent person; or, 3. That
   there has existed from eternity a succession of these organized beings,
   producing one another in a continued series; so that while the
   individuals in the series perish, the succession is eternal.

   The first supposition is too extravagant, we should think, to have any
   advocates. Indeed, as it relates to the bodies of animals and
   vegetables, we have a certain demonstration, that their organization
   has a beginning. 1. Eternity of the universe. And if every thing was
   from eternity, every thing would be immutable and imperishable; but we
   see every kind of organized bodies tending quickly to destruction. Our
   souls also had a beginning, for their gradual increase and development
   is a matter of daily observation. We have no remembrance of an eternal
   existence, nor any consciousness of independence, which must be an
   attendant of an eternal being. We are conscious that we cannot cease to
   be, nor control our own destiny. Nothing is more certain in the mind of
   all thinking men, than that we who now live are creatures of yesterday.
   But it is unnecessary to refute an error which perhaps no one is so
   unreasonable as to hold.

   2. The hypothethesis of evolution. Let us then consider that
   atheistical, or rather pantheistical scheme, which attributes all the
   appearances of design in the world to the world itself; that is, to
   certain causes existing in the world which produce beings of various
   species, not by creation out of nothing, which they hold to be
   impossible, but by an evolution or development of principles contained
   in the world itself. According to this theory the world is God, and all
   things are parts of this one being.

   Denies a personal God. This theory would avoid the name of Atheism,
   which has ever been odious; but it retains the virus of the poison of
   Atheism under another name. It admits a cause, or rather multitude of
   causes, capable of producing these marks of design; but denies that
   this cause, considered as one or many, is a person. Personality. The
   question necessary to be determined is, what is necessary to constitute
   a person? Here we have intelligence in the cause, in the highest
   conceivable degree. But the structure of the body of man is not mere
   intelligence; there is an adaptation of means to an end. This supposes
   the exercise of choice or selection, which is obviously an exercise of
   will. Every instance of contrivance therefore evinces the exercise of
   an intellect and will; and that being in which these two properties are
   found, we are accustomed to denominate a person.

   A single cause demanded. It would be difficult to find a better
   definition of a person. But we need not dispute about the name; when
   there is manifest evidence of wise contrivance in the effect, there
   must be an intelligent cause to produce such an effect. Where, we ask,
   is that cause? Is it in the individual which exhibits these signs of
   design? That would be to make the same thing cause and effect. Is there
   then for each individual in which wise contrivance appears a particular
   cause; or is nature or the world to be considered one general cause,
   operating in a multitude of ways? To suppose a particular cause for
   every one of these effects, would be to multiply deities beyond the
   wildest mythology of the heathen; for these causes being intelligent
   beings, possessing a wisdom beyond our conception, each is properly
   considered a separate deity. But even this supposition comes utterly
   short of furnishing a satisfactory account of the phenomena of the
   universe; for the admirable contrivances in the natural world consist
   very often in the adaptation of things which are entirely distinct, to
   each other, as of the light to the eye, the air to the ear and to the
   lungs, the food to the stomachs of the various species of animals, & c.
   The same adaptation is equally obvious in the vegetable world. That
   cause, therefore, which produced the eye must have produced the light;
   and the cause of the curiously-contrived apparatus of hearing must have
   formed the air; and the author of the stomach must have adapted it to
   various kinds of food, & c. The hypothesis of an infinite number of
   separate, intelligent causes, will not be maintained. All these effects
   must be attributed to one cause, and that cause must be infinitely wise
   and powerful, to give existence to so many wonderful works.

   Attributes required in this sole Cause. If, then, there is one cause of
   all these different species of beings, which could not exist without
   wise contrivance, that cause must be powerful, intelligent and
   benevolent; but power, wisdom, and intelligence can exist only in some
   being, and that being which possesses them must be a person. The
   Pantheist will allege that these attributes belong to the universe
   itself, and therefore there is no need to suppose any being to exist
   separate from, and independent of the world. All these phenomena
   arising, are only the developments of this one substance, in which the
   attributes before mentioned have their seat.

   The Pantheistic reply examined. Before we receive such an opinion, let
   us inquire what constitutes the universe, as far as our knowledge can
   extend. We become acquainted with the world without us by our senses.
   Trusting to the information of these inlets of knowledge, we find that
   the universe consists, as far as known to the senses, of peculiar
   objects, combined together in various ways. These material things,
   though subject to peculiar laws, appear entirely destitute of
   intelligence. In this, all men agree. The light, the air, the water,
   the rocks, the earth, the metals, & c., are not capable of thought.
   Indeed, every material thing with which we are acquainted consists of
   an infinite number of parts, even when of the same kind, and no
   otherwise related to each other than that they are situated near to
   each other; whether they are at all in contact, we do not know. If
   thought belonged to matter, each of these infinitesimal particles of
   matter would be a conscious being, and his consciousness be independent
   of every other particle. By what medium of communication could these
   particles of matter agree on forming an organized body? But the
   Pantheist does not believe that matter is endued with thought. His
   theory is, that in the world there exists not only external substance,
   but thought or intelligence in the same substance. But as this
   intelligence must have a subject in which it resides, and of which it
   is a quality, and as it cannot be an attribute of brute matter, there
   must exist a substance distinct from matter, of which it is a property.
   Matter being divisible, inert, and extended, cannot have intelligence
   as an attribute, which is active, indivisible, and unextended.
   Extension, and thought, therefore, cannot be properties of the same
   substance. If then the cause of the phenomena of nature which indicate
   design is in the world itself, the world must, besides the gross matter
   which we see and feel, be possessed of a soul, or spiritual substance,
   in which this intelligence resides. This would bring us to the old
   Pagan theory of the Soul of the World. Under the material part, but
   under this only, there is a spiritual substance, a soul; just as in a
   man, we can see and feel the body, but we know that within this case,
   there exists a spiritual substance or soul. This theory, then, admits
   the existence of a great spirit, possessing the attributes necessary to
   account for all the appearances of wisdom ill the world. It differs
   from the common theistical doctrine only in this, that it would confine
   this being to the world; but for this, there could be assigned no valid
   reason. A being-possessing such power over matter as to mould it into
   every organized form found in animals, vegetables, and minerals, must
   have a complete control over matter, and be perfectly acquainted with
   all its most hidden properties and capabilities, and must be
   independent of matter, and must exist every where, to carry on the
   processes of nature. And as we do not know the extent of the material
   universe, we can set no limits to the presence of this spiritual,
   intelligent and omnipotent being. The object of Pantheism is to get
   clear of the idea of a personal God, who gives laws to creatures, and
   superintends and governs them according to their natures. But the
   hypothesis, if it could be established, does not answer the purpose for
   which it was devised. Still, even according to the hypothesis, we must
   have a personal God, who knows all things and rules over all.

   3. Eternal succession. The only other atheistical method of accounting
   for the phenomena of the world, as indicating the most consummate
   wisdom, as well as the most omnipotent power, is the hypothesis, that
   the universe in its present form has existed from eternity, and that
   all the various species of animals and vegetables now observed have
   always existed, and have communicated existence to one another in an
   endless series. And as an eternal series has no beginning, it can have
   no cause. There is therefore no need of supposing any first cause, from
   whom every thing has proceeded. As we must suppose some being to exist
   from eternity, we may as well suppose that the world which we see is
   that eternal being.

   Fortress of Atheism. This has always been the stronghold of atheism,
   and therefore deserves a more special attention. The only reason,
   however, which gives an advantage to this theory is, that it carries us
   back into the unfathomable depths of eternity, where our minds are
   confounded by the incomprehensibility of the subject. It is also to be
   regretted that some truly great men, in attempting to refute this
   theory, have adopted a mode of reasoning which is not satisfactory.
   This, we think, is true with respect to Bentley, who possessed a
   gigantic intellect; and, as might have been expected, many are his
   followers. Dr.; Samuel Clarke has also pursued a course in his
   reasoning on this point, which, to say the least, is not entirely free
   from objection. The same may be said of many others, and especially of
   some who have attempted a mathematical demonstration of the falsehood
   of an infinite series of living organized beings, including the
   celebrated Stapfer.

   Argument against eternal series. It will be an object, therefore, to
   free the subject as much as possible from intricacy and obscurity, and
   to present arguments which shall be level to any common capacity
   accustomed to attend to a train of reasoning. We may certainly assume
   it as an admitted principle, that every effect must have not only a
   cause, but an adequate cause. If wise contrivance and evident
   adaptation of means to an end be found in the effect, to ascribe it to
   an unintelligent cause, is as unsatisfactory as to assign no cause.

   An adequate cause still indispensable. This then being assumed, we
   would take this position as incontrovertible, that if design manifest
   in one effect requires an intelligent cause, the same necessity
   requires the same kind of a cause for any number of similar effects;
   and the conclusion must be the same, whether the number is finite or
   infinite. This evident truth has been often and happily illustrated, by
   supposing a chain suspended before our eyes, but reaching beyond the
   sphere of our vision. The lowest link requires a support, and so does
   the second, and there is no less need of support for every successive
   link as you ascend the chain; and if you suppose as many links beyond
   your sight, as there are atoms in the universe, still the same
   necessity of a support is presumed to exist. There must ultimately be a
   support for all these suspended links. No relief from making series of
   effects infinite. But suppose some one to allege that the chain is of
   infinite length, and has no beginning, we immediately begin to
   experience some confusion of ideas. We attempt to grasp infinity, and
   finding ourselves baffled in the attempt, we are apt to lose sight of
   the proper logical conclusion in this case. The necessity of a
   supporting power has no dependence on the number to be sustained. If
   one, if one hundred, if one thousand require support, so does any
   number of links. The conclusion is not in the smallest degree affected
   by the number, except that the more links, the stronger must be the
   supporting power; but this has nothing to do with our present argument.
   The conclusion will be of the same kind, and will as necessarily
   follow, in the case of effects which have in them the marks of design.
   The number cannot affect the conclusion. If one such effect cannot
   exist without an intelligent contriver, an infinite number of great
   effects cannot. If multiplying one cipher, or zero, by any number in
   arithmetic, produces nothing, and the same is the result of multiplying
   a thousand ciphers, the conclusion is inevitable, that an infinite
   number of ciphers multiplied by any number cannot result in any
   positive quantity. Indeed, if all the individuals in the supposed
   infinite series are of the same kind, all are effects, and it is absurd
   to conceive of an effect without a cause. Cause and effect are
   correlative and imply each other; and if an effect cannot exist without
   a cause, much less can an infinite number of effects exist without an
   adequate cause.

   Cause must be existing and operative. My next argument will leave out
   of view altogether the idea of infinity, which is so apt to confound
   the mind. It is this. Every effect must not only have a cause, but that
   cause must be in existence and operation; for it would be absurd to
   think of a cause operating, when it no longer had an active existence.
   Let us then take that individual of a series of organized beings which
   came last into existence. Let it be an animal--a dog or horse. This
   individual we know came recently into being; when produced there must
   have been an adequate cause in existence and in operation. What was
   that cause? The hypothesis confines us to the preceding series of
   animals of the same species, supposed to have come down in
   uninterrupted succession from eternity. But whether the series be long
   or short, finite or infinite, is of no consequence as it relates to our
   present argument. What we are inquiring after is a cause in existence
   at the time this curiously organized and animated being came into
   existence. Now at that time, the individuals of the series had all
   ceased to exist, except the immediate progenitors. Whatever cause
   existed, cannot therefore be looked for in them; and if the effect is
   such as manifestly to be beyond any power and skill which they
   possessed, the contriving and efficient cause cannot be found in the
   series. There must be a higher cause.

   The whole power of the cause must be carried through the series. But
   lest some persons should have a vague notion that some hidden power
   might be communicated through the series, although not found in the
   progenitors of the animal under consideration, I will lay down a
   principle which is admitted in mechanical powers, and is equally
   applicable to all causes. It is this. In all cases where any power is
   communicated through a series of individuals, the whole power necessary
   to produce the effect, must not only be communicated to the first, but
   to every single thing in the series, until it reach the last, which is
   intended to be affected by the original power. Thus, suppose it to be
   required to communicate motion to a ball in a plane, by sending an
   impulse through a hundred balls, the principle known to all
   mechanicians is, that the force necessary to give the desired motion
   must be communicated to the first, and from the first to the second,
   and so on, until it reaches the ball intended to be moved. And this
   principle is equally applicable to all causes which operate through a
   succession of particulars. If at the commencement of a series, an
   intelligent cause operated, and then ceased, or stopped short of the
   last effect, no sign of intelligence could exist in this, which brings
   us back to the same obvious principle with which we commenced, viz.,
   that when any effect is produced, an adequate cause must exist, and be
   in operation at the time of its production. The simple inquiry then,
   is, had the progenitors of this dog, or horse, when the animal came
   into existence and became animated, the skill necessary to continue the
   animal frame, with all its curiously contrived parts, and power and
   skill to give to this individual that constitution of instincts,
   appetites, and passions suited to its condition in the world, which it
   possesses. I leave the atheist to answer this question? The same course
   of reasoning will be equally forcible as applied to fruits and
   vegetables. Every one of these organized beings furnishes an
   irrefragable argument for the being of a God; for in any one of these
   is evidence of the existence of a wisdom and power which certainly do
   not exist in the several particulars of which the series consists.

   The Atheistie objection of Hume. The only modern attempt to invalidate
   the argument for the being of God founded on the appearance of design
   in the universe, is that of Mr. Hume, which is substantially this, that
   this argument supposes that we have seen similar works performed, from
   which, by analogy, we conclude that an intelligent cause is necessary
   to account for them; as if we find a watch we believe it to have been
   made by an artist, because we have before observed such works made by
   skilful men; but in relation to the world, it is a singular work,
   entirely unique. We have never seen any world produced, and, therefore,
   the reasoning which would hold in regard to the conclusion that the
   watch was made by an artist does not apply.

   Reply. More importance has been given to this objection, especially by
   Dr. Chalmers, than it deserves. The objection of Hume is a mere
   sophism, and can unsettle no mind which understands the nature of the
   argument in question. According to Mr. Hume's argument we could not
   infer from any work of art that it had an intelligent author, unless we
   had seen a work of the very same kind by an artist. Suppose a boy who
   has never been away from his father's farm, where he has seen nothing
   superior to ploughs, carts, and harrows, to be conducted to a seaport,
   and to see a steam-frigate. As he has never seen on the farm any thing
   formed like this, according to Mr. Hume, he could not infer that this
   stupendous work was produced by an intelligent cause. To the boy it
   would be a singular effect, the like of which he had never witnessed,
   and, therefore, he could infer nothing respecting it. Now every child
   knows better than this. Any boy of common sense will conclude in a
   moment that this steam engine must have been the work of a skilful
   artificer.

   The world not a singular effect. In order to apply the argument from
   design, it is not at all necessary that we should have seen an artist
   engaged in producing its like. All that is necessary is, that there
   should immediately appear an adaptation of means to produce a certain
   end; and it matters not as to the argument whether we ever conceived of
   a similar work, or knew any thing of the artist, the certain appearance
   of design, or a skilful adaptation of means to an end is always
   sufficient to produce the certain conclusion that there has been a
   designing cause at work. The works of nature are not a singular effect,
   as far as the argument a posteriori is concerned. The adaptation of
   means to an end in these is similar to the works of design among men.
   The difference between a telescope and the eye of an animal is not so
   great as between a plough and a steam engine. If there was any
   difference between the inference from seeing a steam-frigate or a
   complicated spinning engine, which have never been seen before, and
   another plough or cart, it would be in favour of the contrivance not
   before witnessed. The argument seems to be a fortiori in this case. And
   as the whole argument in regard to the works of man is founded simply
   on observing an adaptation of means to accomplish an end, and not the
   adaptation to produce some particular end which we had before seen
   effected by similar means; and as the adaptation of means to an end is
   as evident in the works of nature as in the works of man, the argument
   is as conclusive in one case as in the other.

CHAPTER XXIX.

  THE PHENOMENA OF THE UNIVERSE.

   Accords with phenomena. LET us now suppose that a Great Intelligent
   First Cause exists, and has existed from eternity; are not all the
   appearances of the universe correspondent with the existence of such a
   being?

   Unreasonable to ask more evidence. Again we may demand of an Atheist
   what other evidences of the existence of God he would require. Let him
   suggest something, which, in the form of evidence, would be more
   satisfactory to him, and he will not find it easy to fix on any
   evidence which is stronger or more suitable than what we already
   possess.

   Atheist challenged to propose any stronger. It may appear strange to
   some that we challenge the Atheist to demand any clearer or stronger
   evidence of the existence of a Supreme Being than that which is already
   before us. But let the attempt be made to conceive of some evidence of
   this truth which would be more satisfactory, and better adapted to be a
   standing proof to all nations, and we have mistaken the matter, if the
   result will not be that the existing evidence is as good as any which
   they could ask. It will be worth while to spend a little time in
   considering this point, for if we cannot satisfy the Atheist of the
   truth of our position, the discussion may be satisfactory to others who
   have not been accustomed to view the subject in this light.

   Visibility of God not requisite. It is true we do not see God, and the
   reason is, he is a spirit; and a spirit, from the very nature of the
   case, is invisible. We cannot see the souls of our nearest friends; we
   know that they exist, not by any direct perception of the intelligent
   substance, but by the actions which they perform through the
   instrumentality of the body. If God were not a spirit he could not be
   an active, intelligent, powerful, and perfect being; but being a spirit
   he must be invisible. Nothing is visible but material substances, and
   these only by means of light reflected from them to the eye.

   Invisible existences are believed in. It is not forgotten that most
   Atheists, being materialists, deny that there is any such substance as
   spirit; but they do not and cannot deny that there is something within
   us which thinks and feels and wills, and has power to originate bodily
   motion. Call the substance, of which thought is a property, by what
   name you please, still it is an invisible substance. Who can pretend to
   see a thought or a volition? or who would say that he can see the mind,
   and describe its shape and give its magnitude and dimensions? Let it be
   supposed then that the cause of all intelligence has a nature
   resembling this intelligent nature of which we are every moment
   conscious, but far more excellent, as it must b supposed that every
   excellence exists in a higher degree in the cause than in the effect.

   In no way could a spiritual Being be better revealed. Now supposing
   such an intelligent being to exist, call him spiritual or material,
   only let him be a being of thought, will, and passion; and that he is
   necessarily from his nature invisible to eyes of flesh; the question
   is, how could such a being make himself known to rational minds such as
   ours. As we cannot by any direct perception look into the mind of
   another, and as such a being cannot make himself visible without
   assuming a gross body, we can conceive of no way by which he can make
   himself known but by performing some act, or exhibiting to us some work
   which shall contain the impress of his character. For if he should
   assume a bodily shape, and thus make himself visible, it would not be
   the intelligent substance which we perceived, but a body, which was no
   part of his essence. If an intelligent creature could be so situated in
   the universe as to have no opportunity of contemplating any work of
   God, such a creature could never arrive at the knowledge of his
   existence. But the supposition is impossible; for an intelligent
   creature could not exist without the consciousness of its own thoughts;
   and in the mind itself, even if it were cut off from all perception of
   material things, there is sufficient proof of an efficient, intelligent
   cause. The impress of the divine attributes is as clearly printed on
   the soul as on any of the works of God to which man has access.

   The First Cause known by his works. As the First Cause, if there is
   one, must be from his nature invisible, the only way by which he can be
   conceived to make known his existence, is by setting before us some
   work, in which his wisdom, power, and goodness may be manifested; and
   by the contemplation of which a rational mind may infer, that a being
   does exist, to whom these properties belong. If then in the various
   objects in the world, there is as much evidence of these attributes as
   we can conceive, and in fact far exceeding our most enlarged
   conceptions, we have the best proof of the existence of a Great First
   Cause, which we could have. The simple question then is, could there be
   exhibited stronger evidences of wisdom than we have in the structure of
   the body of man, and in the constitution of his mind? Could the various
   species of animals in the earth, air, and sea, be formed with more
   consummate wisdom than they are, in relation to the climate in which
   they live, and the provision made internally and externally for their
   subsistence, and the propagation of their kind. Examine also the
   vegetable world. Call in the aid of glasses to inspect the concealed
   structure of the vessels; contemplate the leaf, the flower, and the
   mature fruit, and say whether you can conceive of contrivances more
   exquisite. If any man thinks that animal and vegetable bodies could
   have been constructed with more wisdom, let him point out in what
   respects these works of nature are deficient in wisdom But even if it
   were possible to conceive of more perfect works, this could not in the
   least invalidate the argument from them, for the existence of an
   intelligent cause. If the question were of the degree of perfection in
   the wisdom exhibited, then the skill manifested in each work would be a
   proper subject for consideration. An imperfect time-piece proves the
   existence of an artist as fully as one that is perfect.

   This manifestation needs no amendment. But there is here no need of
   this remark, for the Atheist may be defied to conceive of any
   improvement in any of the works of God, in regard to the adaptation of
   the means used to the end to be accomplished; and these evidences of
   the wisdom of God are scattered profusely over the whole universe. We
   cannot turn our eyes to the heaven or the earth, to objects of great
   magnitude, or so small that they can be seen only by the microscope,
   but the same admirable perfection of contrivance is manifest in them
   all. The internal structure of the gnat is as wonderful as that of the
   elephant; and: in the manifestation of wisdom in the creation there is
   a wonderful variety. No two species are exactly alike; and the
   difference is exactly such as it should be to accomplish the special
   end in view. The more intricate our examination of the contrivance and
   evident design in the organization of animal and vegetable bodies, the
   stronger will be our conviction, and the greater our admiration.

   God is clearly manifested. The only question then is, could the
   evidences of intelligence in the cause, if thus innumerable, be
   exhibited in a clearer and stronger light than they are; if not, then
   God could not make known his existence as an intelligent being more
   clearly than he has done. The number of instances in which design
   appears, is far greater than can be examined, and the degree of wisdom
   in the various contrivances in organized bodies, transcends our
   conception how, therefore, could we have by new works, greater evidence
   of an intelligent cause, than we already possess?

   The evidence need not be as great as possible. But there seems in most
   minds a lurking suspicion, that the existing evidence is not as
   convincing as it might have been. Even if this were so, we have no
   right to complain, when it cannot be denied that we have very strong
   evidence. God is not obliged to give to his creatures the strongest
   possible evidence of hisown existence. He may choose to leave scope for
   human industry, and also make the reception of the truth a part of our
   moral probation; and the pleasure of discovering truth after laborious
   research, a part of the reward of virtue. No doubt this is the fact in
   regard to some truths of no small importance. The honest inquirer
   discovers them, while the proud and prejudiced mind, though more acute,
   misses them, and embraces in their stead dangerous error. In
   maintaining, therefore, that the evidence for the being of God is as
   convincing as it could be to an impartial, rational mind, it is not
   because such clearness is considered essential; but simply because the
   fact appears to be as stated.

   Can stronger proof be proposed? But since many may still suppose that
   they can imagine much stronger proof than any which exists, let us
   consider what can be alleged in favour of this opinion.

   Supposition of address to the ear. Could not God speak to us in a voice
   of thunder, and thus make himself known? Undoubtedly he could; and such
   a voice would doubtless greatly terrify us; but would it be a stronger
   proof of his wisdom and power than the works of nature which we behold?
   If this tremendous sound were heard very often, it would at length
   become familiar, and would cease to produce the same impression as at
   first. If heard but seldom, it would leave a suspicion that it might
   have been no more than a disordered imagination. But how could we be
   sure that the voice proceeded from a being who would not deceive? The
   mere hearing the noise could give us no certain evidence of the
   character and veracity of the speaker?

   A visible glory not convincing. But perhaps it may be thought that a
   glorious visible appearance would place the matter beyond all
   possibility of doubt. The majestic appearance of a divine person,
   would, it may be alleged, satisfy every one. The same objections may be
   made to this species Of evidence, as to the former; how could we know
   that this visible appearance was that of the Great First Cause?
   Unnatural appearances prove nothing respecting the character of the
   person who assumes them; if such apparitions were only occasionally
   exhibited, we should be prone to doubt of their reality; and if
   frequent, we should become too much accustomed to them to receive any
   impression. But whatever impression such appearances might make,
   considered as evidence of an all-perfect Deity, they would not be
   comparable to that which we have in the works of nature.

   Miracles. But if the Supreme Being exists, why could he not make
   himself known by working stupendous miracles? Of course, if miracles
   might be demanded by one, all have the same need; and the same claims
   and miracles would become so common, that it would be difficult to
   distinguish them from natural events. And again, miracles require no
   more power to produce them than is required to produce common events.
   In many cases they would require no more than a cessation of the power
   by which natural events are produced. The standing still of the sun, or
   the stopping of the rotation of the earth, would be nothing else than
   removing the impulse by which they were originally put in motion.

   Are effects of power. In a miracle, we only see the effect of divine
   power. We may infer from this, that there is a Being who can change the
   laws of nature; and a miracle taken by itself can prove nothing more.
   But in the works of nature, we have innumerable proofs of the wisdom
   and beneficence of the Author of the Universe. And the number, variety,
   and wisdom of these works are evident to every person of common sense.
   The proofs of a great intelligent cause are spread out, over the
   heavens and the earth, the sea, and the air. We are little affected by
   these objects, because they have ever been before our eyes since our
   earliest infancy. But as evidences of a Divine existence their force is
   not diminished by the uniformity of the laws of nature, by which they
   are continually produced, but greatly increased. The different species
   of animals and vegetables have successively been reproduced, according
   to laws that never vary; and this shows that the plan of the Almighty
   is perfect, and that He can accomplish all his pleasure, and has given
   uniform laws to every kind of being which his wisdom and power have
   produced.

   But add nothing to proof of power. It is not denied that miraculous
   displays are a decisive proof of a Great First Cause, who is possessed
   of omnipotence; but what we maintain is, that the evidence of
   omnipotence is not greater than in the natural effects which are
   constantly produced before our eyes. And as to the character and
   attributes of God, they are far more clearly exhibited in the various
   productions of nature, than they would be by a miraculous
   interposition. If another sun were placed in the heavens, which is as
   great a miracle as we can imagine, it would be a proof of mighty power,
   but not a stronger proof than the existence of the natural sun; and as
   to the wisdom and goodness of the Deity, there would be no comparison,
   for in the former case, nothing but the existence of Omnipotence could
   be inferred from the miracle, for there would be no appearance of
   wisdom in such a miracle. But in the existence of the natural sun,
   which gives light, heat, motion, and life to all earthly living things,
   the wisdom and goodness of the Creator are most illustriously
   displayed. Who can enumerate the benefits which are derived from the
   influence of the sun? and the same sun, which communicates so many
   blessings to our world, dispenses blessings in the same way to other
   planets.

   Result of the argument. If we saw the dead raised in a thousand
   instances, it would be a decisive evidence of the existence of a Being
   of almighty power; but the evidence is fully as strong from the
   formation and vivification of innumerable animal bodies of many
   species. And no miracle can be conceived, which would furnish stronger
   evidence of the Divine existence, than the works of creation which are
   ever before our eyes and our minds. I think, after what has been said,
   that we cannot wish for more convincing evidence of the existence of a
   Supreme Being, than we already possess in the works of nature spread
   out before us; and even if we were shut up in a dark dungeon, we have
   this convincing evidence in our own persons, in the constitution of
   both our souls and bodies.

   The demand of self-evidence. The only thing which can be alleged
   further is, that this might have been made a self-evident truth as much
   as our own existence, or the existence of the world without us; and
   many formerly entertained that opinion that the idea of God is innate,
   and that a speculative Atheist is a thing impossible. Some very learned
   and respectable philosophers and theologians have expressly inculcated
   this opinion in their writings. Now, although we do not believe there
   are any innate ideas, and although the existence of God can scarcely be
   said to be self-evident, yet in the proof of it, there is but a single
   step of reasoning. It is a self-evident truth that every effect must
   have an adequate cause; and when there is evident design in the effect,
   the cause must be intelligent. The conclusion is so easily drawn from
   an intuitive truth, that it is not wonderful that it should be classed
   among self-evident truths. We can scarcely conceive of the state of
   that mind which after seriously contemplating the wonderful evidences
   of design in the human frame, can doubt the existence of an intelligent
   First Cause, and an intelligent cause producing effects by a wise
   adaptation of means to a definite end, and the harmonious operation of
   thousands of parts in the vital functions must, according to every
   proper definition of the term, be a person.

   Attributes of God. All the arguments by which the being of God is
   proved, involve the proof of some of his attributes. If the marks of
   design in creatures prove the existence of a Creator, it is by showing
   that he must be possessed of wisdom to cause so many wonderful
   contrivances as we behold in the world. As the operation of any cause
   is the exertion of power, so the creation of the world is the action of
   omnipotence. A greater power than that which brings something out of
   nothing cannot be conceived: this indeed we cannot comprehend, and,
   therefore, some who admit that the world is the work of God, as far as
   relates to the organization and moulding of matter, yet cannot be
   persuaded that omnipotence itself can give existence where there was
   none before. But if God did not create the matter that is in the world,
   whence came it? There are but two suppositions; one is, that matter
   existed from eternity, and is, therefore, self-existent and
   independent; the other, that it is an emanation of the divine essence.
   The first is inadmissible; it supposes two eternal beings independent
   of each other, and the latter leads to pantheism, or that all things
   are a part of God; as whatever emanates from him must be a part of his
   essence, for this is immutably the same. Though wisdom and power are
   the attributes which are first observed, they are not the only
   attributes of which we may learn something by studying the works of
   nature. For when we attentively consider the nature of the end, to
   accomplish which the innumerable contrivances are adapted, we cannot
   but observe that this end is beneficent. All the parts of animals are
   connected with the vitality, enjoyment, and preservation, of the animal
   or species. The goodness of God is therefore as manifest in the
   creation, as his wisdom. There is not a part in any animal body which
   can be shown to be without its use. Every species is fitted by the
   bodily structure, and by the instincts and passions with which it is
   endued, to enjoy in the most perfect degree that kind of life to which
   it is destined. Even the minutest animalculæ have bodies organized with
   as exquisite skill as those of the larger species. No living creature
   exists for which food is not provided, suited to the appetite and
   nourishment of the species, and which it has the means of procuring. So
   every species is endowed with the instinctive ability to provide for
   itself and its progeny suitable places of residence; and there are
   insects which, though they undergo a remarkable metamorphosis and
   change of appetites, are still able by their instinct to find the
   nourishment which is agreeable and necessary. And what is still more
   wonderful and indicative of far-seeing wisdom in the Creator is the
   fact, that these insects which were once in the chrysalis state, and
   afterwards assume the form and instincts of butterflies, are led by an
   invariable propensity to deposit their eggs on plants necessary for the
   young grubs, but on which they themselves never feed. Were it not for
   this wise provision for the young, they would all perish. Between the
   animal and vegetable world there is a beautiful harmony; the latter to
   a large extent supplies food for the former. It may be thought that the
   constitution of things by which one animal preys upon another, is an
   argument against the goodness of God; but these animals are only
   intended for a transitory existence, and as they all must die, and are
   tormented with no apprehensions in regard to the future, and the pain
   indeed is momentary, if they enjoy much more pleasure than pain during
   their existence, there seems to be no solid objection against this law
   of nature.

   Objections from existence of pain. It has often been alleged as an
   atheistical objection against the goodness, and by consequence, against
   the existence of God, that pain or misery has a place among his works.
   This perhaps is the most plausible of all objections which infidels
   have ever produced; and yet it has no certain principles on which to
   rest. With a system such as the present, where there is a gradation of
   sensitive beings, it is impossible for us to conceive how all pain
   could be excluded. As far as we can see, the susceptibility of pleasure
   carries with it a liableness to some degree of pain. What if the pain
   which animals endure arise out of the principle of self-preservation,
   and from the appetites, in the gratification of which consists their
   enjoyment? Without desire and appetite there could be no animal
   enjoyment, and when the safety of the animal requires it, it is wisely
   ordered that by uneasiness or pain it should be stimulated to seek its
   necessary food, or flee from danger.

   Miseries of the human race. And as to man, while in the present world
   we cannot conceive how he could have any enjoyment, unless he was also
   subject to such feelings of uneasiness human race. as rendered him
   capable of relishing his enjoyments. This remark relates to pains which
   cannot be avoided, such as the pain of hunger and thirst, and the pain
   arising from contact with some injurious body. The surface of man's
   body is the chief seat of pain, because danger commonly approaches him
   from without. It does not appear, therefore, possible that such a
   system of creatures as exist in the world could be constituted so as to
   be exempt from all un easy feelings. To make creatures whose
   constitution would exempt them from all liableness to pain, would, as
   far as we can see, exempt them from all susceptibility to pleasure. And
   as to those evils which men bring upon themselves by imprudence,
   intemperance, injustice, or by disobeying the voice of conscience
   within them, they must be attributed to themselves and not to the
   constitution of the world. And as God is not obliged to make every
   creature as great and as happy as it could be made, it may seem to
   exhibit his wisdom and power to produce beings in whose existence there
   is a mixture of natural good and evil.

   Moral perfections of the First Cause. It appears clear, then, that the
   Author of this universe is powerful, wise, and beneficent; but how does
   it appear that he is possessed of a moral character? that he loves
   moral excellence, and disapproves of moral evil? This appears evidently
   from the moral constitution of man. The law interwoven in his
   constitution proves that his Maker approves of moral excellence. Again,
   it would be absurd to suppose that the creature could possess an
   excellence, and one superior to all natural endowments, of which there
   was no prototype in the Great First Cause. We may lay it down as a
   maxim, that whatever perfection we can conceive of must exist in the
   most perfect degree in the Creator, for all our ideas of perfection are
   derived from the contemplation of creation; and whatever excellence
   there is in the creation must exist in the Creator.

   Divine approbation of virtue. Besides, by the laws of nature, virtuous
   conduct is generally productive of pleasure and peace of mind; and
   immoral conduct is generally a source of misery. These laws of nature
   are the laws of God, and manifest his approbation of virtue and
   disapprobation of vice.

CHAPTER XXX.

  DUTIES OF MAN TO THE CREATOR AS THUS MANIFESTED.

   Foundation of law. HAVING given, in a summary, the proofs of the
   existence and character of God, so far as reason can guide us in the
   inquiry, we are now prepared to consider the relation in which man
   stands to God, and the obligations which arise out of this relation. As
   man himself, in the wise and wonderful constitution of his mind and
   body, has been supplied with the most striking and convincing evidences
   of a powerful, wise, and beneficent Author of the universe; we are led
   at once to see, that God, as being the Creator of man, and the Giver of
   all his remarkable endowments, has a perfect right to claim his
   obedience, to the utmost extent of his powers. And on taking an
   impartial survey of the origin of his being, of the goodness of the
   Creator in his various beneficent endowments, and of his continual
   dependence, not only for the continuance of his being, faculties, and
   susceptibilities, but also for all those gifts of divine Providence
   necessary to his health and comfort, man cannot but feel that he is
   under the strongest moral obligation to obey, honour, and glorify his
   Maker, with his best affections and most strenuous exertions. This is
   the foundation of what is called the law; that moral law which is, as
   it were, written on the heart of every man; for what man is there, who
   has come to the exercise of reason, who does not perceive a clear
   distinction between right and wrong? And where can be found a human
   being, who, upon having his relation to God as his Creator set before
   him, does not feel in his conscience, that he is under a moral
   obligation to be subservient to his will?

   General obligation. The general obligation on all moral agents, to
   serve their Creator, is evident enough. It will require some time, and
   careful consideration of this relation in which man stands to his
   Maker, to ascertain the particular duties which are obligatory on all
   men.

   Particular obligation. This we shall now attempt, so far as reason can
   guide us in this matter.

   Here it may be proper to remark, that the essence of all obedience is
   internal; Obedience internal.that is, consists in the dispositions,
   affections, and purposes of the heart. Outward actions partake of a
   moral nature, only so far as they proceed from these internal
   affections. Human laws must be satisfied with external obedience,
   because human lawgivers cannot search the heart, nor scrutinize the
   motives of those who owe obedience. But even earthly judges, in
   administering justice, endeavour as far as human judgment can go, to
   discover from what internal motives any action under examination was
   performed; and their decision of acquittal or condemnation is grounded
   on the opinion which they form of the intention and motives of the
   person under arraignment. Much more then does the moral Governor of the
   World require of his creatures the obedience of the heart; for he
   possesses a perfect knowledge of what is in the heart of every one; and
   a most perfect estimate of the nature of moral good and evil as those
   qualities exist in the human heart. It seems evident, therefore, that
   the laws of nature demand the highest degree of excellence of which the
   mind of man is capable. And as God possesses every moral attribute in
   the highest perfection, it is reasonable to infer, that man, as he came
   from the hands of his Creator, was endued with the seeds and principles
   of every moral virtue. And if the nature of man is not now found
   adorned with these moral excellencies, he must in the exercise of his
   free will have departed from his primeval state. Our present inquiry,
   however, is not whether man has fallen from his original integrity, but
   what are the duties arising out of man's relation to God as his
   Creator, Benefactor, and Preserver. Infinite excellency. Although the
   obligation to obedience arises primarily from the relations just
   mentioned, yet it is necessary to take into view the supreme excellence
   and majesty of the character of God; for if pious and devout sentiments
   towards God be required, it is because there is in the character of God
   as exhibited in his works, something to call forth such affections,
   from rational and rightly disposed minds. If God were not supremely
   excellent, it would not be reasonable to demand supreme love from his
   creatures, and so of other things. But as we know that God is possessed
   of every excellence in an infinite degree, there exists an object for
   every affection and sentiment toward him, of which the human mind is
   capable. From what has been said it is evident, that in order to
   perform any other duties to the Creator, some knowledge of his true
   character is requisite. Without knowledge the rational mind cannot
   exercise right affections.

   Adoration. Supposing then a rational mind, such as it is reasonable to
   think man possessed, when he proceeded from the hands of his Maker, and
   possessing that knowledge of his attributes which may be learned from
   his works, what would be the first thoughts and feelings of the newly
   created soul? In our judgment, the first feeling would be an emotion of
   profound veneration, or perhaps the word adoration would more strongly
   indicate the state of the mind, absorbed in the contemplation of a
   Being so august, so powerful, and so immense. This feeling, then, is
   one which ought to exist in every rational mind toward the Almighty.
   This is the true foundation of divine worship. It is the deep and
   solemn emotion which is the essence of the worship, which holy beings
   in all worlds offer unto God.

   Reverence.And this feeling would lead to a reverence of every thing
   which has any relation to God. His very name would be sacred. We have
   read of men of great eminence who never mentioned that name without a
   solemn pause, or some external token of reverence.

   Thankfulness.The duty which most naturally arises from the relation
   which man sustains to God, as his Creator, Benefactor, and Redeemer, is
   that of gratitude. This is when strong a very lively and impulsive
   feeling. It draws men along as taken captive; and yet the constraint is
   not painful, but pleasing. Under the influence of gratitude, men will
   engage in the most odious duties, and will voluntarily make the most
   self-denying sacrifices. Under the influence of this affection men have
   been willing to lay down their lives. Gratitude is then an important
   principle of man's obedience. It is true, some have attempted to
   degrade this principle as one which scarcely can be said to partake of
   the nature of virtue, because it has respect to self, and to our own
   interest. But though gratitude originates in the sense of benefits
   received by ourselves, it deserves not to be classed with mere selfish
   affections. Its object is to make a return to a benefactor for favour
   received. It is, therefore, an elevated species of justice; for when a
   suitable and adequate return can be made for favonrs received,
   gratitude will not be satisfied until this is done. And in regard to
   the benefits received from our Creator, as an adequate compensation is
   utterly beyond our power, gratitude manifests itself in acknowledgment
   of obligation in thanksgiving and in unceasing praises. There is,
   however, no necessity to argue this matter; the appeal may safely be
   made to the feelings of every rightly constituted mind. All men who
   acknowledge the existence and Providence of God, feel that a debt of
   gratitude is due to their great Benefactor.

   Love.As the mind, when uncorrupted, is so constituted as to love and
   esteem whatever is excel lent, and as moral excellence is superior to
   all other amiable objects; and as God possesses this excellence in an
   infinite degree, it is reasonable that he should be esteemed above
   every other object. Finite minds, it is true, can never exercise love
   proportionate to the excellence of this Glorious Being; but as far as
   they possess the capacity of apprehending it, and the susceptibility of
   affection, they are under moral obligation to love God with all their
   powers. And this cannot be considered as demanding too much of the
   rational creature, for no other measure of affection can be fixed
   without supposing a wrong estimate of the object, or a defect of right
   feeling; for what is more reasonable than to proportion the intensity
   of our affection to the excellence of the object? But in this also, the
   excellency of the object infinitely surpasses our capacity of love, so
   that if the mind should be enlarged a thousand-fold, so as to possess a
   thousand times as great a power of love and esteem as at present, the
   obligation to love God with this increasing capacity would be complete;
   and any less degree of esteem and care would be casting dishonour on
   God. And again, this obligation would exist, even if it were painful to
   come up in our affections to this high demand; but this is so far from
   being the fact, that man's happiness is perfect in the same proportion
   as his obedience is perfect. From every consideration, therefore, it is
   evident that man is bound by the law of his nature, and the relation
   which he sustains to God, to love him with his whole soul.

   Submission. As the will of God is always guided by wisdom and goodness,
   whenever and however this will is manifested, it should be implicitly
   and cheerfully submitted to, even though contrary to our wishes, and
   even what seems best to our reason; which is submission to the
   Providence of God.

   Trust. Another duty clearly incumbent on the rational creature of God,
   is trust or confidence. As man is dependent, and as the supply of his
   necessities can be derived from no other source than from God, it is
   evidently his duty to place his confidence in God for every thing,
   believing in his goodness, faithfulness and power.

   Prayer. This trust in God, however, involves the duty of prayer. It is
   as natural and reasonable for a dependent creature to apply to its
   Creator for what it needs, as for a child thus to solicit the aid of a
   parent who is believed to have the disposition and ability to bestow
   what it needs. Plausible objections have been raised against the duty
   of prayer, derived from the omniscience of God, and from his immutable
   purposes. But these objections possess no real validity. For although
   God knows perfectly beforehand what his creatures need, yet the
   acknowledgment of their dependence is manifestly proper, and the
   offering of petitions for such things as they need, has a tendency to
   keep up a proper sense of dependence. And as God deals with his
   creatures according to the nature which he has given them, it is proper
   that he should require of them such dispositions and acts as are
   becoming independent creatures. This, too, is in accordance with the
   conduct of men on whom others are dependent. The object of prayer,
   including praise, is to preserve in the mind a right state of feeling
   towards a Being to whom it owes every thing, and from whom alone
   blessings can be expected. The highest privilege of the most exalted
   creature is to enjoy communion and intercourse with the Infinite Source
   of all good. Prayer is the only means which man enjoys of holding
   immediate intercourse with his Maker. And this privilege is the highest
   honour which he can enjoy in the present state. So also, it is a means
   of the most sublime happiness. By this exercise he draws near to God,
   and when such approaches are made sincerely and affectionately on his
   part, it cannot be doubted that Divine communications will be
   vouchsafed, and the light of the Divine favour be lifted upon him, and
   the answer to his prayers be granted by the dispensations of divine
   Providence toward him.

   Not inconsistent with Divine plan. As to the objection derived from the
   immutability of the Divine purposes, it arises from a narrow view of
   this subject, which leaves out an import ant part of the Divine plan.
   The purposes of God, though immutable, are not inconsistent with the
   freedom of the creatures, nor with the use and efficacy of appropriate
   means. The truth is, all these acts and means are included in the
   Divine plan. If God has decreed that a certain field shall produce a
   plentiful crop; he has also decreed that all the influences of sun,
   rain, and the necessary labour shall take place. And if he has purposed
   to bestow certain favours on his rational creatures, he may in the same
   manner purpose that these benefits shall be given in answer to prayer;
   so that prayer may be considered as the means by which these blessings
   are obtained as truly as a plentiful crop is the effect of a skilful
   and laborious tillage of the ground.

   Outward acts of religion. As to external acts of devotion, reason and
   nature teach that humility and reverence in our words, attitudes, and
   gestures are highly proper when we address our praises unto God. When
   we are filled with devotional feelings, nature prompts to give
   utterance to our emotions; and the use of appropriate sounds and
   gestures seems also to keep up and increase the feelings of the mind.
   These outward expressions, however, are not essential to acceptable
   prayer. The silent breathings of desire are known to God, and will be
   acceptable to him. It is reasonable to believe that God never takes
   more complacency in his creatures, than when they come before him in
   the humble, reverential posture of adoration, prayer, and praise.

   Reference to the glory of God. Nothing can be more evident, than that
   the creature should exercise benevolence or good will towards the
   Author of his being. Not that we can desire Him to be more excellent,
   more wise, more powerful, or more independent than he is; but we may
   rejoice in all his attributes and glory in his greatness, and be
   delighted with the idea of his unbounded and uninterrupted happiness;
   and in these elevated emotions of joy, and acts of glorying and
   glorifying God, it is believed that the purest, sublimest, and most
   constant happiness of all holy beings consists. Nothing is more evident
   to impartial reason, than that the glory of God should be the supreme
   object of the rational creature's pursuit. It is, in fact, the noblest
   object which can be considered. We are unable to imagine any thing more
   glorious for God himself to seek, than his own glory. Certainly, then,
   it is the highest end at which any creature can aim; and it is a
   sentiment entirely accordant with reason, that all the creation was
   produced for the purpose of exhibiting the glory of God. And man was
   endowed with a capacity of knowing and loving God, for the very purpose
   of glorifying his Maker. Not that any addition can be made to the
   essential perfection and felicity of the Eternal One; but the
   manifestation of these perfections is what is properly called the glory
   of God.

   Summary. All the duties which have been specified, commend themselves,
   as obligatory on the rational creature, to every impartial mind; all
   that seems further necessary is to give a brief summary of what has
   been said on this subject.

   All included in love. The order in which these devotional exercises are
   set down is not very important; for though there is an order of
   precedence and sequence in all our mental exercises, yet while it is
   unnecessary to speak of these affections which have God for their
   object, seriatim, they are commonly combined and mingled in the
   conscious experience of the mind; so that in the same moment various
   acts and exercises appear to be simultaneous. They may, however, be all
   comprehended under the single term, Love, if we give a genuine meaning
   to that term.

   The summation which seems as proper as any other which occurs, is the
   following:

   Duties to God.1. Adoration, having for its object the greatness,
   majesty, holiness, and incomprehensibility of God.

   2. Admiration, or holy wonder of the wisdom of God in the multiplied
   contrivances and organizations in the created universe.

   3. Esteem for and complacency in God's moral excellence.

   4. Desire of Union and Communion with God, and of conformity to his
   character.

   5. Gratitude for his goodness manifested in all creation; but
   particularly to man, in the constitution of his soul and body, and in
   the provision made by the providence of God for the subsistence and
   comfort of the human family, and of all living creatures.

   6. Trust, or Confidence in God, as a benignant and kind Father and
   Protector, who will not abandon the work of his own hands, nor be
   wanting in contributing to their happiness in future, as long as they
   are obedient to his will.

   7. Acquiescence in the will of God, and submission to those
   dispensations which even cross the natural feelings, is an evident
   moral duty. Indeed, the surrender of soul and body to God, to be used
   and disposed of by him for his own glory, is the state of mind of which
   the moral faculty approves.

   8. Prayer to God for such things as we need, is a duty dictated by the
   law of nature, including suitable expressions of our devotional
   feelings in words and gestures. But no creature has a right to
   institute or adopt any ceremonies of worship which God has not
   appointed.

   9. Making the glory of God the supreme end of all his actions, the
   object of his constant and untiring pursuit; and rejoicing and
   triumphing in the infinite glory, independence, immutability, and
   blessedness of God.

   What reason affirms of man's fall en state. The above enumeration, it
   is believed, comprehends the internal acts and exercises in which the
   duty of man to God consists, which duties plainly arise out of the
   attributes of God and man's relation to him, as his Creator, Preserver,
   and Benefactor. And if man had never failed in the performance of these
   duties--if he had continued to exercise those affections which
   spontaneously spring up in his soul, when he came from the hands of his
   Creator, this world, instead of being a land of misery, would now have
   been a blooming paradise of joy. And we may be sure that a good God who
   loves all his creatures according to their actions, would never have
   permitted the natural evils which now oppress the human soul, to have
   entered into the world. Sickness, famine, and death in its thousand
   different forms, would have been unknown.

   Conclusion. It is evident from the slightest view of the character of
   man in all ages and countries, that he has lost his primeval integrity,
   that the whole race have by some means fallen into the dark gulf of sin
   and misery. This, reason teaches; but how to escape from this wretched
   condition, she teaches not.

  FINIS.
