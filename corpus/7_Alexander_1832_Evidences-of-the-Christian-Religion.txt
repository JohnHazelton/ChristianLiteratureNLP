   CHAPTER I.

  THE RIGHT USE OF REASON IN RELIGION.

   THAT it is the right and the duty of all men to exercise their reason
   in inquiries concerning religion, is a truth so manifest, that it may
   be presumed there are none who will be disposed to call it in question.

   Without reason there can be no religion; for in every step which we
   take, in examining the evidences of revelation, in interpreting its
   meaning, or in assenting to its doctrines, the exercise of this faculty
   is indispensable.

   When the evidences of Christianity are exhibited, an appeal is made to
   the reason of men for its truth; but all evidence and all argument
   would be perfectly futile, if reason were not permitted to judge of
   their force. This noble faculty was certainly given to man to be a
   guide in religion, as well as in other things. He possesses no other
   means by which he can form a judgment on any subject, or assent to any
   truth; and it would be no more absurd to talk of seeing without eyes,
   than of knowing any thing without reason.

   It is therefore a great mistake to suppose, that religion forbids or
   discourages the right use of reason. So far from this, she enjoins it
   as a duty of high moral obligation, and reproves those who neglect to
   judge for themselves what is right.

   But it has frequently been said by the friends of revelation, that
   although reason is legitimately exercised in examining the evidences of
   revelation, and in determining the sense of the words by which it is
   conveyed; yet it is not within her province to sit in judgment on the
   doctrines contained in such a divine communication. This statement,
   though intended to guard against the abuse of reason, is not, in my
   opinion, altogether accurate. For it is manifest, that we can form no
   conception of a truth of any kind, without reason; and when we receive
   any thing as true, whatever may be the evidence on which it is founded,
   we must view the reception of it to be, reasonable. Truth and reason
   are so intimately connected that they can never, with propriety, be
   separated. Truth is the object, and reason the faculty by which it is
   apprehended; whatever be the nature of the truth or of the evidence by
   which it is established. No-doctrine can be a proper object of our
   faith which it is not more reasonable to receive, than to reject. If a
   book, claiming to be a divine revelation, is found to contain doctrines
   which can in no way be reconciled to right reason, it is a sure
   evidence that those claims have no solid foundation, and ought to be
   rejected. But that a revelation should contain doctrines of a
   mysterious and incomprehensible nature, and entirely different from all
   our previous conceptions, and, considered in themselves, improbable, is
   not repugnant to reason; on the contrary, judging from analogy, sound
   reason would lead us to expect such things in a revelation from God.
   Every thing which relates to this Infinite Being, must be to us, in
   some respects, incomprehensible. Every new truth must be different from
   all that is already known; and all the plans and works of God are very
   far above and beyond the conception of such minds as ours. Natural
   religion has as great mysteries as any in revelation: and the created
   universe, as it exists, is as different from any plan which men would
   have conceived, as any of the truths contained in a revelation can be.
   But it is reasonable to believe, what by our senses we perceive to
   exist; and it is reasonable to believe, whatever God declares to be
   true.

   In receiving, therefore, the most mysterious doctrines of revelation,
   the ultimate appeal is to reason. Not to determine whether she could
   have discovered these truths; not to declare, whether considered in
   themselves, they appear probable; but to decide, whether it is not more
   reasonable to believe what God speaks, than to confide in our own crude
   and feeble conceptions. Just as if an unlearned man should hear an able
   astronomer declare, that the diurnal motion of the heavens is not real
   but only apparent, or that the sun is nearer to the earth in winter
   than in summer; although the facts asserted, appeared to contradict his
   senses, yet it would be reasonable to acquiesce in the declarations
   made to him by one who understood the subject, and in whose veracity he
   had confidence. If, then, we receive the witness of men, in matters
   above our comprehension, much more should we receive the witness of
   God, who knows all things, and cannot deceive his creatures, by false
   declarations.

   There is no just cause for apprehending, that we shall be misled by the
   proper exercise of reason, on any subject, which may be proposed for
   our consideration. The only danger is, of making an improper use of
   this faculty, which is one of the most common faults to which our
   nature is liable Most men profess, that they are guided by reason in
   forming their opinions; but if this were really the case, the world
   would not be overrun with error; there would not be so many absurd and
   dangerous opinions propagated, and pertinaciously defended. They may be
   said, indeed, in one sense, to follow reason, for they are guided by a
   blinded, prejudiced, and perverted reason.

   One large class of men are accustomed, from a slight and superficial
   view of the important subject of religion, to draw a hasty conclusion,
   which must prove, in the highest degree, detrimental to their
   happiness. They have observed, that in the modern, as well as ancient
   world, there is much superstition, much imposture, much diversity of
   opinion and variety of sects, many false pretences to Divine
   Inspiration, and many false reports of miracles, and prophetic oracles:
   and without giving themselves the trouble of searching diligently for
   the. truth, amidst the various contending claims, they draw a general
   conclusion, that all religions are alike: that the whole affair is a
   cheat, the invention of cunning men who imposed on the credulity of the
   unthinking multitude: and that the claims to Divine Revelation, do not
   even deserve a serious examination. Does right reason dictate such a
   conclusion as this? If it did, and we were to apply it to all other
   concerns, it would make a sad overturning in the business of the world.
   Truth, honesty; and honor might, on these principles, be discarded, as
   unmeaning names; for of all these there have been innumerable
   counterfeits, and concerning all of them, an endless diversity of
   opinion.

   A second class, who profess to be men of reason, pay more attention to
   the subject of religion; but their reason is a prejudiced judge. They
   listen with eager-. ness to, all that can be said against revelation.
   They read with avidity the books written against Christianity, and but
   too faithfully treasure up every objection to religion; but her
   advocates. never obtain from them a fair hearing. They never inquire,
   whether the arguments. and objections which appear to them so strong,
   have not been refuted. With the means of conviction within their reach,
   they remain firmly fixed in their infidelity; and as long as they
   pursue this partial method of investigation, they must ever remain in
   the same darkness.

   A third class, who wish to be considered as taking reason for their
   guide, are under the dominion of vicious passions; of ambition,
   avarice, lust, or revenge. Men of this character, however strong their
   intellect, or extensive their erudition, can never reason impartially
   on any subject which interferes with the gratification of their
   predominant desires; and as religion forbids, under severe penalties,
   all irregular passions and vicious indulgences, they pursue it with
   malignant hatred. As one well observes, "they are against religion,
   because religion is against them" Such men never reason calmly on the
   subject, and they are incapable of receiving any benefit from the
   arguments of others. They never think of religion but with a feeling of
   enmity, and they never speak of it but in the language of sneer, or
   abuse. There is no object which this race of infidels. have more at
   heart, than to root up every principle of religion from the minds of
   men, and to drive it from the earth, so that not one vestige of it
   might remain to give them torment. Voltaire may be considered as the
   leader. of this band; and his humble imitators, have been too numerous,
   in every Christian country.

   But there is still another class of men, more distinguished, as masters
   of reason, than those who have been mentioned. They are the cold,
   speculative, subtle set of skeptics, who involve themselves. in a thick
   mist of metaphysics; attack first principles, and confound, their
   readers with paradoxes. The number of those who belong to this class,
   is, perhaps, not large, but they are formidable: for while the other
   enemies of the truth, scarcely make a show of reason, these
   philosophers are experienced in all the intricacies of a refined logic;
   so that in their hands, error is made to appear in the guise of truth.
   Should we yield ourselves to the sophistry of these men, they will
   persuade us to doubt, not only of the truth of revelation, but of our
   senses, and of our very existence. If it be inquired, how they contrive
   to spread such a colouring of skepticism over every subject; the answer
   is, by artfully assuming false principles as the premises of their
   reasoning; by reasoning sophistically on correct principles; by the
   dexterous use of ambiguous terms; by pushing their inquiries beyond the
   limits of human knowledge; and by calling in question the first
   principles of all knowledge. But it is not easy to conjecture what
   their motive is; most probably, however, it is vanity. They are
   ambitious of appearing more profound and acute than other men; and
   distinction is not so readily obtained in the common course, as by
   flying off in an eccentric orbit. It cannot be any sincere regard for
   truth, which influences them; for, upon their principles, truth and
   reason are equally worthless. They pull down every thing, but build up
   nothing in its place. Truth has no greater enemies in the world than
   this Pyrrhonic sect.; and it is to be lamented, that, sometimes,
   ingenious young men are caught in the wiles of their sophistry, and are
   led so far into the labyrinth of their errors, that they are never able
   to extricate themselves; and all their fair prospects of virtue and
   usefulness are obscured forever.

   Before I leave the consideration of the various classes of persons,
   who, while they profess to be guided by reason, make an improper use of
   this faculty, I ought to mention a set of men, distinguished for their
   learning and ingenuity, who profess to receive the Christian
   revelation, and glory in the appellation of Rational Christians. They
   proceed on the plausible and (if rightly understood) correct principle,
   of receiving nothing as true, but what their reason approves; but these
   very men, with all their fair appearances of rationality, are
   chargeable with as gross a dereliction of reason, as can well be
   conceived; and, in regard to consistency, are more vulnerable, than any
   of those already mentioned. For, while they admit, that God has made a
   revelation, they insist upon the right of bringing the truths revealed,
   to the test of human judgment and opinion, and reject diem as
   unreasonable, if they do not accord with this standard. But. the
   declaration of God is the highest reason which we can have for
   believing any thing. To set up our opinion against the plain expression
   of his will, is surely presumption of the highest kind. Perhaps,
   however, I do not represent the case with perfect accuracy. Perhaps, no
   man is chargeable with such an inconsistency, as to admit a thing to be
   contained in an undoubted revelation, and yet reject it. The exact
   state of the matter is this. The Scriptures, it is admitted, contain a
   revelation from God; but there are many things in the Bible, which, if
   taken in the most obvious sense, are inconsistent with reason; now, as
   nothing inconsistent with reason can be from God, it is concluded, that
   this cannot be the true sense of Scripture. Accordingly, their wits are
   set to work, and their learning laid under contribution, to invent and
   defend some other sense. Upon these principles, a man may believe just
   as much, or as little as he pleases, of what the Bible contains; for it
   has been found that no text is so stubborn as not to yield to some of
   the modes of treatment which have been adopted:, But I maintain, that
   this whole procedure is contrary to, right reason. The plain course
   which reason directs us to pursue, is, after examining the evidences of
   revelation; and being satisfied, to come to the interpretation. of the
   Scriptures with an unbiassed mind; and in the exercise of a sound
   judgment, and with the aid of those helps and rules which reason and
   experience suggest, to obtain: the sense of the several parts of the
   document and although this sense may contradict our preconceived,
   opinions, or clash with our inclinations,. we ought implicitly to
   receive it; and not by a refined ingenuity, and labored critical
   process, extort a meaning, that will: suit our own notions. This is not
   to form our opinions by the Word of God, but to cut down the sublime
   and mysterious doctrines of revelation, to the measure of our. narrow
   conceptions. And thus, in the creed of many, called rational
   Christians, the divine system of heavenly truth is shorn of its glory,
   and comes forth little more than an improved theory of Natural
   Religion. There is no reason in this.

   But what if the plain sense of Scripture be absolutely repugnant to the
   first principles of reason? Let that be demonstrated, and the effect
   will be, rather to overthrow the Scriptures, than to favor such a
   method of forming a theory from them. But no such thing can. be
   demonstrated. The reasonings by which it has been attempted to prove,
   that the doctrines, commonly called orthodox, are contrary to reason,
   are fallacious; and a similar mode of reasoning, on the truths of
   Natural Religion, will land us in atheism.

   Deistical writers have been fond of representing faith, and reason as
   irreconcilable. They have insinuated, and even asserted, that
   revelation cannot be received without a renunciation of reason; and
   have affected to regret, that it should be subjected to the trial of a
   rational investigation, which they allege, it can by no means bear.
   This was a favorite topic with Morgan, Bolingbroke, Voltaire, and Hume.
   The last mentioned author, in the close of his far famed Essay on
   Miracles, uses the following language; "Our most holy religion is
   founded on Faith, not on reason, and tis a sure method of exposing it,
   to put it to a test, which it is, by no means fitted to endure."--And
   again: "Mere reason, is insufficient to convince us of its [the
   Christian Religion's] veracity, and whoever is moved by faith to assent
   to it, is conscious of a continual miracle, in his owns person, which
   subverts all the principles of his understanding."

   On the insidious nature of this attack, I shall not stop to remark,
   except to observe, that it may be taken as a specimen, not only of
   Hume's method of treating Christianity, but of that of the whole tribe
   of deistical writers, until very recently, when they have come out
   boldly. Under the mask of friendship, and with the words of
   respectfulness on their lips, they have aimed the most deadly thrusts
   at the vitals of Christianity. But in regard to the sentiment;
   expressed in this extract, the friends of revelation utterly disclaim
   it, and hold it to be false and unfounded. The state of the controversy
   between Christians and deists, did not authorize any such assertion.
   The defenders of the truth have ever been ready to meet their
   antagonists on the ground of impartial reason. They have met them at
   every point, where they have chosen to make the assault; and I may
   safely say, that no deistical argument remains unrefuted, no infidel
   objection undetected and unexposed.. As. Mr. Hume wrote this
   immediately after finishing his argument against miracles, perhaps he
   felt a confidence, that he had achieved what none before were able to
   effect. But his confidence was premature: the argument which he claims
   the honor of having discovered, (though this might be disputed on good
   ground,) has been refuted, with a clearness of evidence, sufficient to
   bring conviction to any mind, but that of a sophist and a skeptic. But
   we shall have further occasion, in the sequel, to consider the force of
   Mr. Hume's reasonings against miracles.

   It may, perhaps, require some apology, that a subject which has been so
   fully and ably discussed, in numerous volumes, should be attempted to
   be treated in a short essay. My only apology is, that the poison of
   infidelity is imbibed by many, who never have access to the antidote.
   It is much to be regretted that some of the books which are almost sure
   to fall into the hands of literary youth, are deeply tinctured with
   skepticism. How many read Hume and Gibbon, who never have seen the
   answers of Campbell and Watson. Now, if we can present, even a brief
   outline of the evidences of Christianity, to those who may not be
   disposed to read larger works, we may be contributing, in some small
   degree, to prevent the progress of one of the greatest evils to which
   men are liable.

CHAPTER II.

   IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BANISH ALL RELIGION FROM THE WORLD; AND IF IT WERE
   POSSIBLE, IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST CALAMITY WHICH COULD BEFAL THE HUMAN
   RACE.

   IT is not my object here, to consider religion as it is a matter of
   duty, or a means of obtaining happiness in a future world; for both
   these would be equally disregarded by those men who aim at the
   subversion of all religion. What I shall attempt, at present, is to
   state and establish the fact, that man is so constituted, that he must
   have some sort of religion.

   And the truth of this will be manifest, from an inspection of the
   principles of human nature, and from the history of the world. Man has
   naturally a sense of moral obligation, a perception of the difference
   between right. and wrong, feelings of remorse or approbation on the
   review of his conduct, fears of future retribution when he has
   committed a crime, and a propensity to pay religious homage to some
   object, visible or invisible. These are what have been called his
   religious feelings; and from them he has received the appellation of a
   religious animal. And certainly there is nothing by which man is so
   clearly distinguished from the creatures below him, as this capacity
   for religion; for whatever indications they give of sagacity in other
   matters, it is impossible to communicate to them any ideas of morality,
   or any impressions of a religious nature. Now, that these feelings are
   natural, and not adventitious, is manifest, because they are found to
   exist in men of all ages, of all countries, and in every different
   state of society. And hence, no nation, ancient or modern, has ever
   been found without some kind of religion. It would be as difficult to
   find a whole nation without religion, as to find one destitute of
   speech. Some travellers, it is true, from superficial observation, have
   reported that some savage tribes had no ideas of religion, and no
   species of worship; but on more accurate examination, it has been
   ascertained, that this was a mistake. And from our present knowledge of
   the nations of the earth, we are authorised to assert, that there is
   not one totally destitute of some sense of religion, and some form of
   worship. The same thing was well known to all the wisest men of
   antiquity. It is a fact from which both Plato and Cicero have derived
   many important conclusions. And these principles of our nature are so
   deeply radicated, that they never can be removed. Men may be induced to
   abandon their old religion, and to adopt a new one; but they never can
   remain long free from all religion. Take away one object of worship and
   they will soon attach themselves to another. If unhappily they lose the
   knowledge of the true God, they will set up gods of their own
   invention: or receive them from others. The history of all nations
   bears such ample testimony to this fact, that it cannot be denied. Now,
   this universality of religion evinces, in the clearest manner, that the
   principle is natural, that it is an essential thing in the constitution
   of man: just as the fact, that men are always found living in society,
   proves that the social principle exists, and is natural to man.

   Atheistical men, have, indeed, attempted to trace all religious
   feelings, and all rites of worship, to the craft of priests, and policy
   of rulers; but this opinion is not only unsupported by historical
   testimony, but is most unreasonable in itself. For if there had not
   existed a predisposition to religion in the minds of men, such a design
   would never have been conceived; and if it. had, all attempts to
   introduce into the minds of men, ideas so foreign to their nature, must
   have been abortive.

   At any rate, such an imposition could not have tow tinned for so long a
   time, and could not have been extended to every tribe and nation in the
   world. If no sense of religion had existed in the minds of men, priests
   and politicians, however cunning, would have had no handle to take hold
   of, no foundation on which to build. Besides, it seems to be forgotten
   by the advocates of this hypothesis, that the existence of priests,
   supposes the previous existence of religion.

   They have, moreover, alleged, that fear produced the gods. Be it so; it
   still confirms my position, that there is something in the nature of
   man which leads him to religion; and it is reasonable to conclude, that
   a cause which has operated uniformly, heretofore, will continue to
   produce the same effects as long as the world stands. It is impossible,
   therefore, to banish all religion from the world.

   To what degree, atheists have succeeded, in divesting themselves of all
   religious impression, I do not pretend to know. That some men have gone
   to a great length in counteracting the constitutional tendencies, and
   extinguishing the feelings, of nature, is undoubtedly true; but there
   have been sufficient indications to lead to the opinion, that there is
   more of affectation than reality in the bravery of their profession. It
   is known that some of them have, above other men, been the slaves of
   superstitious fears; and that others, in times of extreme peril, as in
   a storm at sea, have, for the moment, renounced their atheism, and
   cried as earnestly for mercy, as those around them. Now, if these
   philosophers, with all their reasoning, are not able to erase all
   religious impressions from their own minds, it is vain to attempt to
   banish all religion from the world.

   But suppose the great work achieved; and that every vestige of religion
   was obliterated; what would be the result? Would men remain without any
   objects of religious homage? Would they never again be afraid of
   invisible powers? Would the feelings of remorse at no time urge them to
   perform some sort of penance, or attempt some kind of expiation? Would
   no impostors and false prophets arise to deceive the world again with
   their dreams, fancies, and pretended revelations? They must have made
   but superficial observations on human nature, who think that none of
   these things would ever occur.

   If those persons, therefore, who oppose Christianity, hope, by its
   subversion, to get rid of all religion, they do greatly deceive
   themselves. This work being accomplished, they would soon have more to
   perform in endless progression. Instead of the pure, mild, benignant,
   religion of Christ, they would soon find themselves surrounded by
   superstitions as foul and as false, as monstrous and as absurd, as any
   which the hot bed of paganism ever produced. Look into the heathen
   world, and see the abominations and miseries which inveterate
   superstition perpetuates in some of the fairest and most populous
   regions of the globe. Look at the savage tribes of Africa and America,
   and contemplate the cruel bondage of superstition, to which the people
   are subjected. Evils as great would soon grow up among us, were it not
   for the salutary influence of Christianity. Our forefathers, before
   they became Christians, were in the same degraded and wretched
   situation. And shall we curse our posterity by bringing back those
   evils from which our fathers escaped? It is a truth which should be
   proclaimed every where On the house tops, that it is the Bible, which
   has delivered us from the horrid dominion of superstition; and it is
   the Bible, which must prevent its return. Philosophy has had no hand in
   working out this deliverance from the horrors of idolatry. With all her
   celebrated schools and sages, she never turned one individual from the
   worship of idols; and she would be equally powerless in preventing the
   return of superstition, if other barriers were removed.

   But, I proceed now to the second part of my proposition, which is, that
   if religion could be banished from the world, it would be the greatest
   calamity which could befal the human race.

   It has formerly been a matter of discussion with the learned, whether
   the influence of superstition or atheism was most baneful on society.
   Plutarch, Bacon, Boyle, Warburton, and others, have handled this
   subject, in a learned and ingenious manner, and arrived at very
   different conclusions. However doubtful this question may have been
   considered in former times, I believe all reflecting men are now pretty
   well satisfied, that the question is put to rest forever. We have
   recently beheld the spectacle of a great nation casting off
   contemptuously the religion of their fathers, and plunging at once into
   the abyss of atheism. We have seen the experiment tried, to ascertain
   whether a populous nation could exist without the restraints of
   religion. Every circumstance was as favourable to the success of the
   experiment, as it could be. Learning was in its highest state of
   advancement; philosophy boasted of an approximation to perfection; and
   refinement and politeness had never been more complete among any
   people. But what was the result? It is written in characters of blood.
   It was as if a volcano had burst upon the, world, and disgorged its
   fiery flood over all Europe. Such a scene of cruelty, cold-blooded
   malignity, beastly impurity, heaven-daring impiety, and insatiable
   rapaciousness, the world never witnessed before, and, I trust in God,
   will never witness again. The only ray of hope which brightened the
   dismal, prospect was, that this horrible system contained in itself the
   principles of its own speedy downfall, Atheism has no bond of union for
   its professors; no basis of mutual confidence. It breeds suspicion, and
   consequently hatred, in every breast; and it is actuated by a
   selfishness which utterly disregards all the bonds of nature, of
   gratitude, and of friendship. To an atheist, fear becomes the ruling
   passion. Conscious of his own want. of virtue, of honor, and humanity,
   he naturally views his fellows in the same light, and is ready to put
   them out of the way as soon as they appear, in any degree, to become.
   obstacles to the accomplishment of his plans. Hence the bloody actors
   in this tragedy, after glutting their revenge, by shedding the blood of
   innocent Christians and unoffending priests, turned. their murderous
   weapons against each other. Not. satisfied with inflicting death on,
   the objects of their suspicion or envy, they actually feasted their
   eyes, daily, with the streams of blood which incessantly flowed from
   the guillotine. Never was the justice of heaven against impious and
   cruel men more signally displayed, than in making these miscreants the
   instruments of vengeance upon each other. The general state of morals,
   in France, during the period in which Christianity was proscribed, and
   atheism reigned, was such as almost exceeds belief. An eye-witness of
   the whole scene, and an actor in some parts of it, has drawn the
   following sketch:--"Multiplied cases of suicide; prisons crowded with
   innocent persons; permanent guillotines; perjuries of all classes;
   parental authority set at naught; debauchery encouraged by an allowance
   to those called unmarried mothers; nearly six thousand divorces within
   the single city of Paris, within a little more than two years after the
   law authorized them;--in a word, whatever is most obscene in vice, and
   most dreadful in ferocity!" [1] If these be the genuine fruits of
   atheism, then let us rather have superstition in its most. appalling
   form. Between atheism and superstition, there is this great difference;
   the latter may authorize some crimes, the former opens the flood-gates
   to all. The one restrains partially, the other removes all restraint
   from vice. Every kind of religion presents some terrors to evil doers;
   atheism promises complete immunity, and stamps virtue itself with the
   character of folly.

   But we must not suppose that the whole mass of the French people became
   atheists, during this period. Far from it. A large majority viewed the
   whole scene with horror and detestation; but the atheistical
   philosophers had got the power in their hands; and though a small
   minority of the nation, were able to effect so much mischief. But from
   this example we may conjecture, what would be the state of things, if
   the whole mass of people in a nation should become atheists, or be
   freed from all the restraints of conscience and religion. Such an event
   will never occur, but if it should, all must acknowledge, that no
   greater calamity could be imagined. It would be a lively picture of
   hell upon earth; for what is there in the idea of hell more horrible,
   than the absence of all restraint and all hope, and the uncontrolled
   dominion of the most malignat passions! But there would be one
   remarkable point of difference, for while atheists deny the God that
   made them, the inhabitants of hell believe and tremble.

CHAPTER III.

   IF CHRISTIANITY BE REJECTED, THERE IS NO OTHER RELIGION WHICH CAN BE
   SUBSTITUTED IN ITS PLACE; AT LEAST NO OTHER WHICH WILL AT ALL ANSWER
   THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH RELIGION IS DESIRABLE.

   IT has been proved in the former section, that it is necessary to have
   some religion. We are already in possession of Christianity, which, by
   the confession of deists themselves, answers many valuable
   purposes.--ht behoves us, therefore, to consider well, what we are
   likely to obtain by the exchange, if we should relinquish it. If any
   man can show us a better religion, and founded on better evidences, we
   ought, in that event, to give it up willingly; but if this cannot be
   done, then surely it is not reasonable to part with a certain good,
   without receiving an equivalent, in its place. This would be, as if
   some persons sailing on the ocean, in a vessel which carried them
   prosperously, should determine to abandon it, without knowing that
   there was any other to receive them, merely because some of the
   passengers, pretending to skill, suggested that it was leaky, and would
   sooner or later founder.

   Let the enemies of Christianity tell us plainly what their aim is, and
   what they design to substitute in the place of the Bible. This,
   however, they are unable to perform and yet they would have us to
   consent to give up our dearest hopes without knowing what we are to
   receive, or whether we are to receive any thing, to compensate for the
   loss.

   This is a point of vital importance, and demands our most serious
   attention. If it is really intended to substitute some other religion
   in the place of Christianity, we ought certainly, before we make the
   exchange, to have the opportunity of examining its claims, that we may
   know whether it will be likely to answer the purposes for which
   religion is wanted. To bring this subject fairly into view, let us take
   a survey of the world, and inquire, what it has to propose for our
   selection, if we should renounce Christianity.

   There are only three things, in that event, between which we must
   choose. The first, to adopt some of the existing, or some of the
   exploded systems of Paganism; the second, to accept the Koran instead
   of the Bible; and the third, to embrace Natural Religion, or pure
   deism.

   Few men have had the effrontery to propose a return to Paganism: yet
   even this has not been too extravagant for some whose names stand high
   as men of literature. The learned Gibbon has not, that I recollect,
   expressed his opinion, on this subject, explicitly; but it may be
   fairly inferred, from many things in his History of the Decline and
   Fall of the Roman Empire, that he deeply regretted the subversion of
   the old Pagan system, and that the progress of Christianity was far
   from affording him any pleasure.

   But although he makes it sufficiently manifest, that, could his wishes
   have governed past events, the old system would never have been
   disturbed, and Christianity never have had a footing; yet we cannot
   say, whether he would have given his vote to have the temples rebuilt,
   and the Pagan rites restored. It is difficult to tell what he wished to
   accomplish, by his opposition to Christianity; or whether he had any
   definite view, other than to manifest his hatred to the Gospel and its
   Author.

   Taylor, the learned translator of Plato, openly avowed his predilection
   for the religion of the Athenian philosopher, and his wish that it
   might be revived; and, speaks in contemptuous terms of Christianity, in
   comparison with Platonism; but be never could have supposed that to be
   a suitable religion for the bulk of men, which had not the least
   influence upon them, while the philosopher lived. This, then, would be
   no substitute for Christianity; for under its benign influence, even
   THE POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED. UNTO THEM. But I have no doubt,
   that, if the truth could be ascertained, we should find, that this
   sublime genius derived some of his best ideas, directly or indirectly
   from the Scriptures; and that if he had lived under: the light of the
   Gospel, he never would have spoken, of it as his translator has done.

   In the time of the revolution in France, after some trial had been made
   of having no religion, D'Aubermenil proposed a new religion, in
   imitation of the ancient Persians. His plan was to have the Deity
   represented by a perpetual fire, and offerings made to him, of fruits,
   oil, and salt; and libations poured out to the four elements. It was
   prescribed, that worship should be, celebrated daily in the temple,
   that every ninth day should be a sabbath, and that on certain
   festivals, all ages should unite in dances. A few fanatics in Paris,
   and elsewhere, actually adopted the new religion, but they were unable
   to attract any notice, and in a hula. time sunk into merited oblivion.

   It has been common enough to set up the Mohammedan religion, in a sort
   of rival comparison with Christianity, but I do not know that any have
   gone so far as to prefer the Koran to the Bible, except those few
   miserable apostates, who, after being long "tossed about with every
   wind of doctrine," at length threw themselves into the arms of the
   Arabian impostor. How far this religion will bear a comparison with
   Christianity, will be seen in the sequel.

   Deism, or Natural Religion, is then, the only hope of the world, if the
   Christian religion be rejected. To this our attention shall now be
   turned. The first English deists extolled Natural Religion to the
   skies, as a system which contained all that man had need to know: and
   as being simple and intelligible to the meanest capacity. But strange
   to tell, scarcely any two of them are agreed, as to what Natural
   Religion is; and the same discordance has existed among their
   successors. They are not agreed in even those points, which are most
   essential in religion, and most necessary to be settled, before any
   religious worship can be instituted. They differ on such points as
   these; whether there is any intrinsic difference between right and
   wrong; whether God pays any regard to the affairs of man; whether the
   soul is immortal; whether prayer is proper and useful; and whether any
   external rites of worship are necessary.

   But Natural Religion is essentially defective, as a religion for
   sinners, which all men feel themselves to be. It informs us of no
   atonement, and makes no provision for the pardon of sin. Indeed, if we
   impartially consider the law of nature, all hope of pardon must be
   relinquished, because it is a first principle of Natural Religion, that
   every one mill be rewarded or punished exactly according to his works:
   and therefore, if any man sin, he must suffer according to the demerit
   of his crime.

   As this religion teaches no plan of atonement and forgiveness, so it
   inculcates no effectual method of reformation, or purification from the
   pollution of sin, and affords no aid to those who wish to live well,
   but leaves all to be performed by the mere strength of men, which,
   alas! is insufficient to bear up against the power of temptation. In
   those very points in which we want a clear response, Natural Religion
   is silent. It can do no more when its light is clearest, than to direct
   us in the way of duty, and to intimate the consequences of
   disobedience. Deists, then, must lead such lives of perfection, as to
   need no pardon, no regeneration, no aid, no reformation. The system is
   good for them, who can go through life without sin: it sets no hope
   before the mourning penitent.

   Again, if deism be the true religion, why has piety never flourished
   among its professors? why have they not been the most zealous and
   consistent worshippers of God? Does not truth promote piety? and will
   it not ever be the case, that they who hold the truth will love God
   most ardently, and serve him most faithfully?--But what is the fact, in
   regard to this class of men? Have they ever been distinguished for
   their spirit of devotion? Have they produced numerous instances of
   exemplary piety? It is so much the reverse, that even asking such
   reasonable questions, has the appearance of ridicule. And when people
   hear the words "pious deist," they have the same sort of feeling, as
   when mention is made of an honest thief, or a sober drunkard.

   There is no slander in making this statement for deists do not affect
   to be pious. They have no love for devotion. If the truth were known,
   this is the very thing they wish to get rid of; and if they believed,
   that professing themselves to be deists, laid them under greater
   obligations to be devout, they would not be so zealous for the system.
   Believe me, the contest is not between one religion and another, it is
   between religion and irreligion. It is impossible that a man a truly
   pious temper, should reject the Bible, even if he were unacquainted
   with its historical evidences. He would find it to be so congenial to
   his taste, and so salutry in its effects on his own spirit, that he
   would conclude that it must have derived its origin from heaven. But we
   find no such spirit in the writings of deists. There is not in them a
   tincture of piety; but they have more than a sprinkling of profane
   ridicule. When you turn to them from the Bible, you are sensible of as
   great a transition, as if you passed suddenly from a warm and genial
   climate into the frigid zone,. If deists expect ever to conciliate
   regard for their religion, they must appear to be truly pious men,
   sincerely engaged in the service of God; and this will have more effect
   than all their arguments. But whenever this event shall occur, they
   will be found no longer opposing the Bible, but will esteem it as the
   best of books, and will come to it for fuel, to feed the flame of pure
   devotion. An African prince, who was brought to England and resided
   there some time, being asked what he thought of the Bible, answered,
   that he believed it to be from God, for he found all the good people in
   favor of it, and all the bad people against it!

   The want of a spirit of piety and devotion, must be reckoned the
   principal reason why the deists have never been able to establish, and
   keep up, any religious worship among themselves. The thing has been
   attempted at several different times and in different countries; but
   never with any success.

   It is said, that the first enterprise of this kind was that of David
   Williams, an Englishman, who had been a dissenting minister in
   Liverpool, but passing over first to Socinianism, and then to deism,
   went to London, where, being patronised by sonic persons of influence,
   he opened a house for deistical worship, and formed a liturgy,
   consisting principally of praise to the Creator. Here he preached for a
   short time, and collected some followers; but he complained that most
   of his congregation went on to atheism. After four years trial, the
   scheme came to nothing. There were neither funds nor congregation
   remaining, and the Priest of nature, (as Williams styled himself,)
   through discouragement and ill health, abandoned the project.

   Some feeble attempts of the same kind have been made in the United
   States; but they are unworthy of being particularly noticed. [2]

   Frederick II., the deistical king of Prussia, had once formed the plan
   of a Pantheon, in Berlin, for the worshippers of all sects and all
   religions; the chief object of which was the subversion of
   Christianity; but the scheme was never carried into execution.

   The most interesting experiment of this kind, was that made by the
   Theophilanthropists in France, during the period of the revolution.
   After some trial had been made of atheism and irreligion, and when the
   want of public worship was felt by many reflecting persons, a society
   was formed for the worship of God, by the name just mentioned, upon the
   pure principles of Natural Religion. Among the patrons of this society,
   were men beloved for their philanthropy, and distinguished for their
   learning; and some high in power.

   La Revelliere Lepaux, one of the directory of France, was a zealous
   patron of the new religion. By his influence, permission was obtained
   to make use of the churches for their worship. In the city of Paris
   alone, eighteen or twenty were assigned to them, among which was the
   famous church of Notre Dame.

   Their creed was simple, consisting of two great articles, the existence
   of God, and the immortality of the soul. Their moral system also
   embraced two great principles, the love of God, and the love of
   man;--which were indicated by the name assumed by the society. Their
   worship consisted of prayers, and hymns of praise, which were
   comprehended in a manual, prepared for a directory in worship. Lectures
   were delivered by the members, which, however, underwent the inspection
   of the society, before they were, pronounced in public. To these were
   added some simple ceremonies, such as placing a basket of fruits and
   flowers on the altar. Music, vocal and instrumental, was used: for the
   latter, they availed themselves of the organs, in the churches. Great
   efforts were made to have this worship generally introduced, in all the
   principal towns in France; and the views of the society were even
   extended to foreign countries. Their manual was sent into all parts of
   the republic, by the minister of the interior, free of expense.

   Never did a society enjoy greater advantages at its commencement.
   Christianity had been rejected with scorn: atheism had for a short time
   been tried, but was found to be intolerable: the government was
   favorable to the project; men of learning and influence patronised it,
   and churches ready built, were at the service of the new denomination.
   The system of Natural Religion, also, which was adopted, was the best
   that could have been selected, and considerable wisdom was discovered
   in the construction of their liturgy. But with all these circumstances
   in their favor, the society could not subsist. At first, indeed, while
   the scene was novel, large audiences attended, most of whom, however,
   were merely spectators; but in a short time, they dwindled away to such
   a degree, that instead of occupying twenty churches, they needed only
   four, in Paris; and in some of the provincial towns, where they
   commenced under the most favorable auspices, they soon came to nothing.
   Thus they went on declining, until, under the consular government, they
   were prohibited the use of the churches any longer; upon which they
   immediately expired without a struggle; and it is believed that not a
   vestige of the society now remains.

   It will be instructive and interesting to inquire into the reasons of
   this want of success, in a society enjoying so many advantages.
   Undoubtedly, the chief reason was, the want of a truly devotional
   spirit. This was observed from the beginning of their meetings. There
   was nothing to interest the feelings of the heart. Their orators might
   be men of learning, and might produce good moral discourses, but they
   were not men of piety; and not always men of pure morals. [3] Their
   hymns were said to be well composed, and the music good; but the
   musicians were hired from the stage. There was also a strange defect of
   liberality in contributing to the funds of the society. They found it
   impossible to raise, in some of their societies, a sum which every
   Christian congregation, even the poorest, of any sect, would have
   collected in one day. It is a fact, that one of the societies
   petitioned government to grant them relief from a debt, which they had
   contracted, in providing the apparatus of their worship, not amounting
   to more than fifty dollars, stating that their annual income did not
   exceed twenty dollars. In the other towns, their musicians deserted
   them, because they were not paid, and frequently, no person could be
   found to deliver lectures.

   Another difficulty arose--which might have been foreseen. Some of the
   societies declared themselves independent; and would not agree to be
   governed by the manual which had been received, any further than they
   chose. They also remonstrated against the authority exercised by the
   lecturers in the affairs of the society, and declared, that there was
   danger of their forming another hierarchy. There were also complaints
   against them, addressed to the ministers, by the agents of government
   in the provinces, on account of the influence which they might acquire,
   in civil affairs.

   The Theophilanthropists were, moreover, censured by those who had made
   greater advances in the modern philosophy, for their illiberality. it
   was complained, that there were many who could not receive their creed,
   and all such must necessarily be excluded from their society. This
   censure seems to have troubled them much; and in order to wipe off the
   stigma, they appointed a fete, which they called the Anniversary of the
   re-establishment of Natural Religion. To prove that their liberality
   had no bounds, they prepared five banners to be carried in procession.
   On the first was inscribed the word, Religion; on the second, Morality:
   and on the others, respectively, Jews; Catholics; Protestants. When the
   procession was over, the bearers of the several banners gave each other
   the kiss of peace; and that none might mistake the extent of their
   liberality, the banner inscribed, Morality, was borne by a professed
   atheist, universally known as such in Paris. They had also other
   festivals, peculiar to themselves; and four in honor of the following
   persons, Socrates, St. Vincent de Paule, J. J. Rousseau, and
   Washington;--a strange conjunction of names, truly! [4]

   I have been thus particular in giving an account of this society,
   because the facts furnish the strongest confirmation of my argument,
   and are in themselves curious and instructive. After the failure of
   this enterprise, deists will scarcely attempt again to institute any
   form of public worship.

   But among those philosophers who believe in the perfectibility of human
   nature, under the fostering influence of increasing knowledge and good
   government, there is a vague theory, of a kind of mental, philosophical
   religion, which needs the aid of no external forms. The primary
   articles of their creed is, that religion is a thing entirely between
   God and every man's conscience; that all our Creator requires, is, the
   homage of the heart; that, if we feel reverence, gratitude, and
   submission, towards him, and act our part well in society, we have
   fulfilled our duty;--that we cannot know how we may be disposed of
   hereafter, and ought not to be anxious about the matter. Whether this
   is expected to be the religion of philosophers only, or also of the
   unlearned, and the great mass of laboring people, I am unable to say.
   But I know, that such a system as this, will, to a large majority of
   every community, be equivalent to no religion at all. The great body of
   the people must have something tangible; something visible, in their
   religion. They need the aid of the senses, and of the social principle,
   to fix their attention, to create an interest, and to excite the
   feelings of devotion. But the truth is, that if the heart be affected
   with lively emotions of piety, it will be pleasant, it will be useful,
   and it will be natural, to give them expression. This will hold in
   regard to philosophers and men of learning, as well as others. Wherever
   a number of persons participate in the same feelings, there is a strong
   inclination to hold communion together; and if sentiments of genuine
   piety exist in the bosoms of many, they will delight, to celebrate, is
   unison, the praises of that Being, whom they love and adore. There is
   no reason why pious emotions, more than others, should be smothered,
   and the tendency to express them, counteracted. Such indeed will never
   be the fact. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak.
   Piety, it is true, consists essentially in the exercise of the heart;
   but that religion which is merely mental, is suspicious; at best, very
   feeble; is not likely to produce any permanent effect on the character
   or comfort of the person entertaining it; and cannot be useful to
   others in the way of example.

   In the year 1802, when Christianity, which had been proscribed in
   France, was restored by an act of government, a speech was delivered by
   one of the councillors of state, which contains excellent sentiments,
   on the subjects here treated. One or two extract will not be
   unacceptable to the reader. "Science can never be partaken of, but by a
   small number, but by religion one may be instructed without being
   learned. The Natural Religion, to which one may rise by the effects of
   a cultivated reason, is merely abstract and intellectual, and unfit for
   any people. It is revealed religion which points out all the truths
   that are useful to men who have neither time nor means for laborious
   disquisitions. Who then would wish to dry up that sacred spring of
   knowledge, which diffuses good maxims, brings them before the eyes of
   every individual, and communicates to them that authoritative and
   popular dress, without which they would be unknown to the multitude,
   and almost to all men. For want of a religious education for the last
   ten years, our children are without any ideas of a divinity, without
   any notion of what is just and unjust; hence arise barbarous manners,
   hence a people become ferocious.--One cannot but sigh over the lot
   which threatens the present and future generations. Alas! what have we
   gained by deviating from the path pointed out to us by our ancestors?
   What have we gained by substituting vain and abstract doctrines for the
   creed which actuated the minds of Turenne, Fenelon, and Pascal?

   I think enough has now been said to establish, beyond all reasonable
   doubt, our second proposition, that if Christianity be rejected, there
   is no other religion which can be substituted in its place; or, at
   least, no other which can at all answer the purpose /or which religion
   is desirable.

   It may also be observed, in conclusion, that the facts which have been
   adduced, not only serve to confirm this proposition, but furnish new
   and cogent arguments in proof of the proposition maintained in the
   preceding chapter.

CHAPTER IV.

   REVELATION NECESSARY TO TEACH US HOW TO WORSHIP GOD ACCEPTABLY--THE
   NATURE AND CERTAINTY OF A FUTURE STATE--AND ESPECIALLY, THE METHOD BY
   WHICH SINNERS MAY OBTAIN SALVATION.

   IT would be superfluous here to repeat what was said in the preceding
   chapter, respecting the need in which man stood of a revelation when he
   first proceeded from the hands of his Creator. The object which we
   have, at present, in view, is, to inquire, whether man, in the
   condition in which we now find him, and in which history informs us he
   has existed for ages, does not stand in urgent need of more light titan
   he possesses; and, whether, there are not some points of vital
   importance, concerning which he must remain in the dark, unless the
   knowledge of the truth is communicated to him by a revelation from God.
   Let it be understood, however, in what sense it is asserted, that a
   revelation is necessary. Of course, it is not meant, that there is any
   natural necessity for such an event; nor is it intended, that God is
   obliged by any necessity, to grant a revelation. The necessity
   contended for, relates altogether to the wants of man. It is found,
   that in all times, and littler all circumstances, he needs information,
   which he cannot obtain from the unassisted exercise of his own reason;
   or, at least, cannot obtain so satisfactorily from this source, as from
   divine revelation.

   For even if it were possible, for a few philosophers of the highest
   order of intellect, by long and profound investigation, to discover all
   the truths absolutely necessary to be known; yet, for the bulk of
   mankind, it might be all important, to have these same things made
   known by divine revelation; because the great majority of our race have
   neither leisure nor ability for such tedious and difficult researches.
   But the truth, as made known by history, is, that on those very points,
   on which it is most needful that man should be instructed, the wise men
   of this world are as much at a loss as the vulgar. They reasoned much,
   and speculated as far as human intellect could go; but instead of
   clearly ascertained truth, they rested at last, in mere conjecture; or
   deviated into gross error.

   Again, if the light of nature were sufficient to shed some light on the
   great truths needful to be known by man; yet a clear, well attested
   communication from heaven, might be of the greatest utility, by
   speaking decisively and authoritatively, in regard to matters,
   concerning which the conclusions of reason are feeble, and uncertain.
   To affect the conscience and influence the heart, it is highly
   important that religious truth should be attended with certainty, and
   should be felt to possess the sanction of divine authority. What men
   discover by the slow deductions of reason, is found to operate feebly
   on the conscience, compared with the persuasion, that God speaks to us,
   immediately, by divine revelation. In reasoning about the most
   important truths, men differ exceedingly from one another; and this
   very circumstance spreads doubt and uncertainty over all their
   speculations. When we peruse the discourses of the wisest of the
   heathen sages, and observe what darkness surrounded them, we cannot but
   feel commiseration for the imbecility of the human intellect; and,
   indeed, the best of them were deeply convinced of the insufficiency of
   their own reason, to guide them; and, sometimes, seemed to entertain a
   glimmering hope, that at some future period, and in some unknown way,
   divine instruction might be communicated to the erring children of men.

   It is also more than probable, that the clearest and most important
   ideas which the heathen philosophers entertained, were not the
   discoveries of their own reason, or a light struck out from an
   observation of the works of nature, but rays of truth derived more
   remotely, or more directly, from divine revelation, as has been
   remarked in another part of this essay.

   But, after all, it is an undeniable fact, that reason, aided as it was
   by tradition, left men to grope in the dark, and to fall into the most
   degrading idolatry. Indeed, although reason may teach that there is a
   God, and that he ought to be worshipped; yet, of what kind his worship
   should be in order to be acceptable, she never has made known, nor is
   it within the reach of her ability. All the rites of worship invented
   by man are altogether unworthy of God; and, truly, it is in the nature
   of things impossible, that men should devise a form of acceptable
   worship, for no service of this kind can be pleasing in the sight of
   God, which he has not himself appointed. Now, if men have lost the
   knowledge of the original institutions of religion; or, if these have
   become altogether corrupt, there must be a new revelation, before man
   will be able to render an acceptable service to his Creator. There is
   good reason to believe, t hat many of the. heathen rites of worship,
   are nothing else but corruptions of divine institutions, which were
   given to man by an early revelation. This seems especially to be the
   fact, in relation to sacrifices, which constituted an essential part of
   the worship of almost all ancient nations; and some vestiges of which
   have come down by tradition, among the most barbarous tribes. Reason,
   certainly, never taught men that shedding the blood and taking away the
   life of an animal, could be an acceptable sacrifice to the deity; or,
   that presenting it on an altar, and consuming it wholly or partially by
   fire, could be a propitiation for sin; and yet these mysterious
   ceremonies were almost as universal as the gift of speech. And between
   the sacrifices of nations, remote from each other, there has been
   remarked, a wonderful similarity in the circumstances of their sacred
   offerings; in the erection of altars; in the pouring out the blood: in
   dividing the animal into pieces; in combining the offering of salt,
   wine, bread, and incense, with the sacrifice of animals; in considering
   the blood and death of the victim, as expiatory for sin; in having an
   order of priesthood to officiate in these sacred rites, who were
   solemnly consecrated to the service, and considered more holy than
   other men; and when, only a small part of the animal sacrificed was
   consumed in the fire, in feasting on the remainder, within the
   precincts of the temple, or sacred enclosure. And this analogy may be
   traced even in the names, by which similar sacrifices were denominated
   among different nations. These, and many other striking resemblances,
   in the rites of ancient nations, go to prove, incontestably, that they
   must have had a common origin; and no account of this is half so
   probable, as that which ascribes sacrificial rites to an original
   revelation, which brings us to see the credibility of the Mosaic
   history, in regard to the origin of religious worship.

   But supposing that any heathen nation should now be convinced of the
   absurdity of idolatry, and should become sensible of their obligation
   to render some kind of external homage to the great Creator, by what
   means could they learn what sort of service would be acceptable? Reason
   could not teach them what rites should be observed. Without a
   revelation from God, they must forever remain without. a form of
   worship; or, if they attempted to invent certain rites, all experience
   teaches, that these human inventions will ever be marked with human
   weakness; and reason herself intimates, that no worship, not appointed
   by God, can be acceptable to him. It appears then, that even if man
   were not a sinner, still he would need a divine revelation, to teach
   him how to render an acceptable worship to his Creator.

   Some infidel writers have pretended, that it is a matter of
   indifference by what rites God is worshipped, and that he is equally
   pleased with the services of all nations, however different from each
   other in their mode of worship. This doctrine is utterly inconsistent
   with the dictates of sound reason. Upon this principle, even human
   sacrifices, which have been so common in the world, would be justified.
   And the most impure and abominable rites would be sanctioned by the
   Deity. The whole worship of Pagan nations, both in ancient and modern
   times, is detestable; and no one who has any just conceptions of the
   attributes of God, can persuade himself, that he ever could be pleased,
   with services so characterized by cruelty, impurity, and folly. Indeed,
   their worship is not directed to the true God, but to the false deities
   of their own invention. They sacrifice not to God, but to devils. They
   substituted for the. august Creator, creatures of almost every kind and
   species. No man, under the government of reason, can look into any
   heathen temple, without being shocked and cort founded with the
   degrading and abominable rites of idolatry. The more this subject is
   contemplated, the more clearly will the necessity of divine revelation
   be felt, and the greater will appear to be its value to the human race.
   Who can read an account of the mythology and idolatry of the ancient
   Egyptians, or of the modern Hindoos, and not be deeply impressed with
   the necessity of something, which might have the effect of dispelling
   this horrible darkness, and breaking asunder these cruel bonds of
   superstition?

   Another argument for the necessity of a divine revelation, is, that
   without it man must remain ignorant of his origin, and his end; and
   utterly unable to account for the circumstances by which he is
   surrounded. He finds himself here upon the earth, and feels that he is
   borne along the stream of time with the rest of his generation, towards
   a dark gulph before him, which he perceives he can by no means escape.
   But when he inquires, respecting the origin of the human race;--when he
   seeks a solution of the enigma of his sinful, suffering, and mortal
   existence, he finds no one among the living or the dead, from whom he
   can obtain the least satisfactory information, on these points. All the
   traditions and histories of men are full of fables; and if they contain
   some rays of truth, they are so mingled with error, that no man can
   distinguish the one from the other. Leaving out of view the history
   contained in the Bible, and all that we can learn from others casts not
   a solitary ray of light on the points under consideration. We have no
   means of tracing up our race to its origin, and the deist can give no
   rational account of the wickedness of men, and of their sufferings and
   death. The darkness and uncertainty resting on these subjects, have led
   many, who rejected the authority of the Bible, to adopt most absurd and
   atheistical hypotheses, respecting the origin of man. Some have
   professed to believe, that the earth and its inhabitants have existed
   from all eternity--which is too absurd to require refutation. Others
   have amused themselves and their readers, with the idea, that
   originally, the human race was merely a species of monkey or baboon,
   and that by degrees they laid aside their brutal appearance and
   manners, and certain inhuman appendages, and having, in process of
   time, invented language, and the arts most necessary to provide for the
   clothing and shelter of the body, they gradually rose higher and higher
   in the scale of improvement, until they arrived at that pitch of
   refinement and civilization, which has been attained by the most
   polished nations. These, it is true, are rather atheistical than
   deistical hypotheses; but they serve to show how little light reason
   can shed on this subject; and, how much we need a divine revelation.
   For the deist can form no theory which can satisfy our reasonable
   desires. He can give no good reason for the moral condition and
   mortality of our race. He may say, that it is the law of our nature;
   but this is merely to declare the fact, and not to account for it.

   But we might, perhaps, be contented to remain ignorant of our origin,
   if we could know what is to be our destiny, hereafter; and how far it
   is connected with our present character and conduct. Reason has exerted
   and exhausted all her resources, to demonstrate a future existence, and
   to place the immortality of the soul on an immovable basis. But what
   has been the result of all these reasonings? Why, a possibility, or, to
   say the most, a strong probability, that the soul survives the body.
   But this, of all others, is the point, on which we want
   certainty--absolute certainty. How painful to be involved in a cloud of
   doubt and suspense, when we look forward to futurity; and, especially,
   when descending into the grave, to have nothing to lay hold of, but the
   conclusions or conjectures of our own feeble reason? That I do not
   depreciate the force of the arguments for the soul's immortality, will
   appear, from the fact, that many of the heathen philosophers held, that
   the soul died with the body;--that of those who believed in a future
   existence, some were of opinion, that after the lapse of a thousand
   years, or some longer period, it would come to an end; others--and
   these very numerous--believed in the doctrine of metempsychosis, or the
   transmigration of souls from the body of one animal to that of another,
   in perpetual succession; and more still, had no other idea of
   immortality, than that the soul--which they thought was a particle of
   deity--would, at death, be refunded into the divine essence; which was
   virtually to deny its future existence, as to its distinct
   personality;--or, as possessing individuality, and consciousness. Even
   such men as Socrates, Plato, and Cicero, had no clear, consistent, and
   satisfactory views of this interesting subject: not because they
   neglected to exercise their cultivated and powerful intellect, upon it;
   for it was a subject, which more than all others engaged their
   thoughts;--but, because it was surrounded by a darkness which
   unassisted reason could not penetrate. O how glad would these sages
   have been to possess one ray of that revelation which our infidels
   foolishly despise! The earlier deists, generally admitted the doctrine
   of a future state of retribution, and affected to believe, that reason,
   was sufficient to establish the doctrine; but their successors, in
   modern times, or at least, a large majority of them, have either
   denied, or called into question, this fundamental doctrine. And if we
   should weigh impartially, all the arguments which have ever been
   adduced, in ancient or modern times, to establish this point, we would
   be obliged to confess that we needed further light. And from the very
   nature of the case, no one can give us an absolute assurance of our
   future and immortal existence, but God alone. It is an event which
   depends on his will, and nothing else. Arguments may be adduced, to
   prove that the soul is naturally immortal; but they prove no more than
   this, that the same causes which effect the dissolution of the body,
   can have no tendency to destroy the existence and activity of the soul.
   And what are called the moral arguments, only go to prove, that if God
   exercises a moral government over his creatures here, there must be a
   place for a just retribution hereafter. But we want, on this point,
   more certainty.--We want one to come from the other world, to tell us
   that there is a future state.--We want to hear the voice of God
   testifying, that there is not only a future state, but a day of
   righteous judgment. Here, every man can judge for himself, whether he
   needs a revelation.

   This argument for the necessity of a divine revelation, will be
   corroborated by observing the state of religion and morals among all
   heathen nations. It has often been remarked, that the most certain
   method of ascertaining what reason is capable of accomplishing, is to
   see what she has actually done in time past; especially, when enjoying
   all the advantages of high culture and extensive information. In
   physical science, we may expect new discoveries by the exercise of
   reason: and the science of morals may in time come to be better
   understood; but if all nations, even the most civilized and learned, as
   well as the rude and barbarous, have utterly failed in forming correct
   opinions, on the most essential points of theology and ethics; and
   have, all of them, fallen into the most absurd and degrading errors;
   and have acquiesced in the most abominable and impure rites of
   idolatry; then, what can be more evident, than that they needed a
   divine revelation? Probably, one reason why the nations were left so
   long to walk in their own ways, was, to convince us of our own
   imbecility, and to prepare us to receive gratefully, when offered, this
   most comprehensive gift of God.

   To do justice to this argument, would require volumes; but as the
   subject has been amply treated by Leland and others, 1 will pass it
   over, by remarking, that the abominable rites of Pagan worship, and the
   shocking cruelties and impurities which have ever been perpetrated
   under the sanction of every heathen religion, make but a faint
   impression on our minds, because we only hear the distant report of
   these things, and are often tempted to think, that the narrative of
   these horrible doings, must be too highly colored: but, the truth is,
   the half, and far more than the half, remains untold, and cannot be
   publicly told, without outrageously offending against decency. It is an
   awful thought, that for so long a time, so many millions of our fellow
   creatures have been under the cruel bondage of superstition;--a slavery
   which affects the mind, and is productive of more human misery than all
   other causes. And as, Paganism still exists, and as its evils are
   unmitigated by the lapse of time, it is an easy matter to compare the
   Christian with the heathen world.--Cast your eye over the map of the
   earth, and say, where is found the densest darkness? Where does the
   light of truth shine? Is not the line of demarkation between light and
   darkness visible? And is it not as evident, as any thing can be, that
   the Bible is a rich blessing to all who possess and read it? We might
   here, also, institute a comparison between those Christian nations
   which freely circulate the Scriptures, and those who lock them up in a
   dead language--but this we omit; and go on to remark, that he who is
   informed of the events which have occurred on missionary ground, in our
   own times, must have his eyes covered with thick scales of prejudice,
   if he does not acknowledge, that the Gospel is the richest benefit
   which can be conferred on Pagan nations. Either then, a vile
   imposture--a cunningly devised fable--has the power of reforming and
   civilizing the most degraded of the heathen tribes; or, Christianity is
   a Divine Revelation; and is still accompanied by the power of God,
   making it effectual to the illumination, conversion, and salvation of
   the gentiles. Let the deist take his choice between these two things.
   But here, permit me to ask, whether, if a company of deists had gone
   out to Africa, or to the Society or Sandwich islands, any such
   reformation would have been wrought? The reader will smile, at the idea
   of a deist turning missionary to the heathen; but this very feeling
   demonstrates, that deism is not to be the means of regenerating the
   world. If the deist was right, certainly be would be the only proper
   person to send on a mission, to convert the idolatrous world. But all
   are ready to pronounce the very idea to be ludicrous. What! a
   missionary society of deists!--Why, they have no confidence in their
   own principles, in this respect; and no zeal for propagating them in
   such a field, and with such sacrifices, as the Christian willingly
   makes.

   But why should I go to distant and heathen lands, to prove that a
   revelation is necessary, when we have proof enough before our eyes. In
   any of our populous cities, we may draw a visible line between that
   part of the population, who are under the light of evangelical truth,
   and those who place themselves out of the reach of all the direct rays
   of the Gospel. Between these two extremes, there is a large class, not
   properly reckoned with either; but let us, without caring for exact
   accuracy in our computation, suppose, that one-third of the adult
   population are regular church-going people, who hear the leading truths
   of the Gospel from Sabbath to Sabbath; and that another third seldom or
   never attend any place of public worship. Between these two classes of
   citizens, we can institute a comparison. Exceptions you may have to
   make on both sides, but taking them in mass, is there any room to doubt
   whether religion is useful and necessary? From which of these classes,
   permit me to ask, are our prisons crowded with inmates? Suppose, first,
   that all those who never read the Bible, and frequent no place of
   worship, were removed from among us, would the state of society be
   meliorated, or deteriorated? Or, again, suppose that all the
   church-going people should be translated to another country, what would
   then be the condition of society? If I am not egregiously erroneous in
   my calculations, on the former supposition, we should be able to
   dispense with most of our means of coercion and restraint, and would
   save the enormous expense of keeping up such an array of courts,
   police-officers, and prisons. And, on the latter supposition, all the
   wealth of the country would be insufficient to provide places of
   confinement, and means of support, for the guilty; or, to come nearer
   to the truth, our large towns would soon become as Sodom; or as a den
   of thieves: and, soon, the doom of Sodom would sink them, never to rise
   again.

   But does any one think that this is not a fair statement of the matter,
   as it seems to take for granted, that there is no religion, nor can be
   any, without revelation?. I would request the person who makes this
   objection to tell me what kind of religion might be expected, if the
   Bible were banished from among us? Suppose then, instead of the
   hundreds of Gospel preachers, whose voices are lifted up on the first
   day of every week, to warn men of the danger of a sinful course, and to
   point out to them the way of life, all their pulpits should be filled
   with infidel lecturers, male and female; what, in your consciences, do
   you think would be the effect on morals and social happiness? We all
   know that many sinners have been converted by the faithful preaching of
   the Gospel; permit me to inquire, do you know, or have you heard of any
   transgressors being turned from the error of their ways, by attending
   on deistical lectures; or even on the theatre, that boasted school of
   morality? No doubt, some of my readers have heard of conversions at
   these places of fashionable resort, but not to righteousness--not to
   God, but the contrary. And, as I have happened to mention the theatre,
   I will further add, that I am far more afraid of the moral influence of
   this institution, than of that of deistical or atheistical lectures;
   not because it pleads for vice--this would not be tolerated--but
   because it draws thousands within the enchanted circle of temptation,
   and plunges thoughtless youth into the vortex of sensual pleasure, from
   which it is difficult to extricate them.

   But I will admit, that there may be much religion, without revelation;
   the whole heathen world is a proof of it. Some men of the world,
   indeed, confound all religions, and all the ministers of religion
   together, as if they were all alike; whereas, true and false religion,
   are as dissimilar, as light and darkness; and I will repeat what I have
   already said in substance, and that is, that, the only effectual
   barrier to false religion, is to cultivate that which is true.
   Infidelity may serve to sweep away one form of superstition, but after
   awhile the tide will turn, and enthusiasm, or superstition, will come
   in like a flood; for, as we have shown, the people must have some sort
   of religion; and if you banish that which is true, rational, sober, and
   benevolent, you will soon he visited with the most absurd and degrading
   systems of wild fanaticism; and these will, when the fires of
   enthusiasm are extinguished, settle down, or rather grow up, into
   hideous forms of superstition. The Pagan religions had some mixture of
   truth derived from early tradition; for they were all, as we have seen,
   a corruption of the primitive worship of fallen man: but banish the
   Bible, and you will have in its place, either the dark horrors of
   atheism, accompanied with crime, in her polluted and blood-stained
   robe, or you will have the reign of superstition, chilling every
   generous emotion--degrading every noble affection--and blighting all
   domestic bliss.

   Sometimes, a splendid temple rests upon a few solid pillars, and falls
   to ruin if they be removed. Thus, the peace and order, and comfort, of
   civil society, depend much on two institutions; for both of which we
   are indebted to revelation. The first of these, is, the SACRED
   INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE: the second is, the RELIGIOUS OBLIGATION OF AN
   OATH, or solemn affirmation, which is virtually the same thing. Remove
   these, and the fair fabric of human happiness totters at once to its
   very base.

   But the argument on which I chiefly mean to dwell, to evince the
   necessity of a revelation, is, that without it, we can never learn how
   sin can be forgiven, or the sinner saved. Admitting then, that reason
   can direct us with sufficient clearness, in regard to all our moral
   duties; and admitting, that if a man performs his duty, no more is
   required of him, and he may confide in the justice and goodness of God;
   and that, in pursuing this course, no evil will ensue, and the suitable
   reward will not be wanting.--I say, admitting all this, for argument's
   sake--yea more, that all men possess this knowledge: yet, I maintain,
   that in relation to the state in which man actually is, it amounts to
   nothing. It is one thing to have a system of religion which suits the
   case of an innocent being, and quite another to find out a plan by
   which A SINNER can obtain forgiveness. A citizen may know full well,
   that if he obeys the laws of his country, he will be protected by all
   upright magistrates; but if he has already violated the laws, and
   incurred a formidable penalty, the knowledge mentioned does not reach
   his case. What he needs now, is to know how he can obtain a pardon, and
   evade the vengeance of the violated law. In every such case, there is
   an absolute need of a declaration, or revelation, from the supreme
   power of the state, of a willingness to pardon, on some certain
   condition. In no government can a pardon be a matter of course, or
   provided for by the law itself: for, such a provision would be
   subversive of all government. It would be a complete nullification of
   the obligation and authority of the law. Here, then, the momentous
   question occurs, is man a sinner? Have all men transgressed the law of
   God? I am willing to waive the proof of this point, for the present,
   and to leave it to the decision of every man's conscience is there then
   a man, upon earth, who is not conscious of having violated the law of
   his nature, both by omissions of duty, and the actual commission of
   sin?

   Assuming it then as a fact, that men are sinners, I ask, what does the
   light of nature teach, respecting the forgiveness of sin? I shall
   endeavor to demonstrate, that reason sheds not a ray of light on this
   fundamental point; and, therefore, that Natural Religion, if known ever
   so perfectly and universally, could not bring us the relief which we
   need. The main argument for the position which I have laid down, is
   short and simple. It is the dictate of right reason, that God is just,
   and will render to every one according to his character and conduct;
   and that his law, being wise and good, must not be violated with
   impunity. Can the deist conceive of an objection to this
   principle?--Certainly not. It must be considered a self-evident truth,
   with every theist who believes in the moral government of God. The case
   is plain, therefore, and as far as the dictates of reason extend, the
   sinner has no prospect before him but to suffer the just punishment of
   his offences, whatever that may be.

   To suppose that reason can inform us that God will pardon our sins, is
   to suppose that its dictates are contradictory; for, to pardon, is the
   same as not to punish; but we have just seen, that the voice of reason
   is, that God is just, and will render to every man what he deserves.
   These two things are not compatible. Before I proceed further, I must
   put the reader on his guard, against loose and illogical reasoning, on
   a point so vital. I scarcely know a subject, on which most men appear
   to satisfy themselves with more vague and fallacious arguments. Some of
   the more common of these, it, will be my object now to consider.

   In the first place, it is alleged, and with much confidence asserted,
   by many, that God is a Being of too much benevolence and kindness, to
   inflict severe punishments on his erring creatures. This
   suggestion--for it has not the shape of an argument--seems to give
   honor to God, while it is very soothing to the mind of the sinner. But
   when it is examined, it will be found to be rather an insult than an
   honor; for it supposes that the Ruler of the universe, out of kindness
   to a rebellious creature, will cease to be just:--that, rather than
   punish offences as they deserve, he will dishonor his own law. What
   sort of compliment would it be to an upright judge, among men, to say
   of him, that we were sure his benevolence and compassion would prevent
   him from inflicting the penalties annexed to the laws? But, if the
   Judge of all the earth, does not act upon the principle of punishing
   all sin as it deserves, on what other principle does he act? Would any
   one say, by punishing it half as much as it deserves;--but this might
   be a severe suffering; therefore, the conclusion to which this
   reasoning must lead, is, that God's goodness will, altogether, and
   forever, prevent him from inflicting any punishment on sin, however
   atrocious it may be. Many, in our days, who are not called deists or
   atheists, but who are more dangerous, because they mingle some Gospel
   truth with their errors, greedily embrace, and zealously inculcate this
   very opinion. But look at its consequences. The infinitely perfect God
   will treat alike the most malignant rebel, and the most affectionate
   and obedient servant. He will, in his treatment of his creatures,
   manifest no more displeasure at sin, than be does towards the most
   perfect virtue. If such benevolence as this existed, it would be no
   moral perfection, but a defect. But no; God's attributes are never at
   variance. There is no goodness in God which forbids or prevents the
   fullest exercise of justice. If ever he chooses to rescue sinners from
   the consequences of their sins, it will not be by sacrificing his
   justice, but by fully satisfying it. But this is an affair of which
   mere reason knows nothing. But if the deist should insist, that all
   moral goodness consists in benevolence, and nothing else, and therefore
   God will not punish any one but for his own good, I answer, that the
   good of the whole is to be preferred, by a benevolent being, to the
   happiness of an offending individual; and in all communities, the
   general good requires, that transgressors should he intimidated and
   restrained by punishment; so that it must be proved, that the good of
   the universe does not require the punishment of the guilty, before any
   such conclusion can be drawn from the benevolence of God.

   It is manifest, therefore, that the suggestion which we have been
   considering, however pleasing to the mind in love with sin, and however
   plausible at first sight, will not bear examination; and instead of
   tending to the honor of God, takes from him all that is estimable in
   moral character. It allows him no other excellence than an
   indiscriminate benevolence to his creatures, without the least regard
   to their moral character. Such a being would not be the object of
   veneration and esteem, by all holy intelligences. An infinitely good
   God may punish transgressors according to the demerit of their climes,
   without any disparagement of his goodness; and an infinitely just and
   holy God must punish sin. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do
   right?"

   Another suggestion, supposed by many to be a dictate of reason, is,
   that all the punishment ever inflicted on men for their sins, is the
   evil which arises out of it from the laws of nature, and the
   constitution of the human mind; and, that there is no good ground for
   any apprehension of any further or greater penalty. Now, let it be, in
   the first place, observed, that there is no proof adduced of the truth
   of this position; nor does it admit of proof. Who can tell what the
   Judge of all may think it necessary to inflict, hereafter, on sinners,
   for the manifestation of his justice, the vindication of his law, and
   as a terror to other offenders? Indeed, as far as we can judge of the
   facts, men do not suffer in this life, in any just proportion to their
   crimes: the wicked are often prosperous; and when the conscience
   becomes callous, they experience but little remorse for their worst
   crimes. Transgressors, who are only beginning their career, experience
   the agonies of an accusing conscience in the keenest manner; while the
   veteran in iniquity has long since ceased to be much troubled with
   these "compunctious visitations." But, supposing it true, that all the
   punishment of sin is that which naturally follows it, yet who can tell
   what all the consequences are, or where they will end? Crimes do not
   always produce their bitterest fruit, immediately. We see the sins of
   the intemperate, the lewd, and the dishonest, often overtaking them
   with their saddest consequences, long after the acts were committed.
   Sins committed in youth often produce a miserable old age. Look into
   the history of multitudes, whose vices have consigned them to a prison,
   or a mad house, and you will find that the cause of their wretchedness
   and disgrace, may be traced back to the sins of their youth: yes--those
   very sins, on which many are disposed to look with so indulgent an eye.
   And as these evils go on increasing until death, who can assure the
   sinner that this fearful progression will not continue beyond the
   grave? As we are not now arguing with atheists, we have a right to
   assume as a truth, the soul's future existence, and if it exist in
   conscious activity, will it not carry with it, the moral character
   acquired in this world? Will not the selfish, the proud, and malignant,
   be selfish, proud, and malignant, when the clay tabernacle is dropped?
   Can death transform a sordid, and guilty creature, into an angel? Will
   not the man who is wicked up to the moment of dissolution, continue to
   he wicked, after death? And will not he carry with him, his memory, his
   conscience, and his craving desires? There is then but little comfort
   for the sinner in this suggestion, if true; for he may find springing
   out of his own corruption, a worm which will never die,. and which will
   gnaw his vitals with as corroding a pain, as any which he is capable of
   enduring. Be it so, that conscience is the only fire to be dreaded in
   another world--who can tell us how intense and interminable the pain
   which this principle of our nature is capable of inflicting on the
   sinner? The fear, remorse, and horrible perturbation, which sometimes
   surround the death-beds of profligate sinners, afford a tremendous
   intimation, of what they may expect in a future, state. How great, or
   how long, the evil consequences. of sin may be, our reason certainly
   cannot tell; as far as her dictates extend, we can see no end to this
   progression in vice and misery.

   But I come now to the consideration of a much. more specious opinion,
   on which, deists, and others who agree with them in these matters,
   place great confidence. it is, that whatever the deserved penalty of
   sin may be, reason teaches us, that it can be set wide, or evaded, by a
   sincere and seasonable repentance. This principle has been assumed as a
   fundamental article in all the systems of sober deists. It is well
   known, that lord Herbert laid it down as one of the five positions, on
   which he founded his system; and, therefore, as perfectly understood by
   all men. And as many who wish to be considered rational Christians,
   adopt the same principle, it has gained very general possession of the
   public mind. And again, as pardon and repentance are closely connected,
   according to the doctrines of the Gospel, this truth of revelation, is
   by many, not distinguished from what is considered a dictate of reason;
   and hence it becomes a matter of real difficulty to separate truth from
   error, on this point; and in attempting it, we must encounter a
   formidable front of prejudice, not only from infidels, but also from
   others. And before I proceed further, I must request the reader to
   separate the evangelical doctrine of pardon, on repentance, from the
   deistical principle under consideration; for they stand on entirely
   different grounds, as will appear in the course of the discussion.

   And here let it be carefully remarked, that before this doctrine of
   reason, as it is called, can become a practical principle, two things
   must be pre-supposed; first, that all men know what that repentance is,
   which will insure our pardon; and next, that every sinner has ability
   to perform it. The reasonableness of these pre-requisites is
   self-evident. But great difficulty attends the theory, as it relates to
   these points. For we would ask, whether by that repentance which reason
   inculcates, any thing more is meant than sorrow or compunction for our
   sins; or whether it includes a thorough reformation of life, and that
   not merely extending to external acts, but to the motives and
   affections of the heart? It is also reasonable to ask, whether any
   certain degree or continuance of sorrow is requisite? And whether
   repentance will not cease to be available, if the sinner revert to his
   former ways of iniquity? Moreover, whether repentance, flowing simply
   from fear of punishment, is genuine; and if not, what sort of
   principles must it have, as its source? It is also needful and
   important to inquire, whether an inveterate, hardened sinner, can
   repent of his sins, so as to hate and forsake them;--and surely no
   other repentance is worth any thing. With a mind filled with error, his
   conscience seared; and his habits deeply radicated, what hope is there
   of his turning about, and commencing a new life? From what principle
   could we anticipate such a change in a confirmed villain, or debauchee?
   You might as reasonably expect the Ethiopian to change his skin, as for
   him that has been long accustomed to do evil, to learn to do well. And
   it will answer no purpose to say, that he can repent if he will, and if
   he will not, the blame is all his own; for, we are inquiring, whether
   reason can teach a method of salvation adapted to the condition of
   sinners, and it matters not whether the obstacle be in the will or in
   something else: if it uniformly prevents the desired effect, it is
   plain, that something else is needed. And as to the blame being on his
   own head, it is admitted; but this is true in regard to every sin; for,
   in every act of transgression the sinner is culpable, otherwise it
   would be no sin; and if the only object be, to fix the blame upon the
   culprit, this is sufficiently provided for, without offering him pardon
   upon repentance; for, life and happiness can be secured, without
   repentance, if men will only obey the law of God perfectly. And there
   is no greater, nor other inability, in the way of his doing this, than
   in the way of his exercising true penitence. There is, manifestly, a
   radical defect in the deistical theory, on this very point; for it
   makes no provision for bringing the sinner to repentance, but merely
   offers pardon, in case he will do that to which his whole heart is
   averse. And does not fact accord with our sentiments? Where are the
   instances of deists repenting of their sins, and yet adhering to this
   system? There are indeed many glorious examples of infidels being
   brought to repentance and reformation, by the Gospel; but I would
   challenge the world to produce an instance of any one being brought to
   repentance, and a thorough change of life, merely on the principles of
   deism. And if the principle is in practice utterly ineffectual, of what
   value is it? and why should it be magnified into a matter of so much
   importance, as to be adduced as a proof that a revelation is not
   needed?

   As, however, I wish to give a full and impartial discussion to this
   point, I will now, for the sake of argument, suppose, that the
   repentance which is necessary to pardon, is understood by all men, and
   that all have ability to perform it. The opinion then is, that all
   sinners by repentance may escape the punishment justly due to their
   sins; and this repentance they can bring into exercise, at any time,
   when it may be needed. Now, if this be true, and a dictate of reason,
   then it must be confessed, that a revelation is not absolutely
   necessary; for what method of salvation can be simpler, easier, or more
   intelligible than this? But, I deny that any such doctrine belongs to
   the system of natural religion, or is dictated by the light of reason.
   This opinion of the efficacy of repentance, is borrowed from the
   Gospel; and has been tacked to deism, with which: it has no coherence.
   The truth is, it is altogether incompatible with the first great
   fundamental principle of natural religion; namely, that God being just,
   will render to every one according to his moral character and conduct.
   And, here, I would repeat what has often been remarked by writers on
   this subject, that deists have ever been in the habit of borrowing from
   revelation, without giving' credit for what they take; and perhaps,
   without knowing whence the sentiment is derived. Men, born and educated
   under the light of revelation, however they may come to reject the
   Bible, and all the positive institutions of Christianity, cannot divest
   themselves of all those important moral principles, which, directly or
   indirectly, they have derived from this source. The light of divine
   revelation is widely diffused in Christian countries, and has given
   complexion to all our laws, institutions, and systems of education; so,
   that a man can no more escape entirely from its influence, than, from
   the effect of the light of the sun. Many truths which the deist
   pretends to have discovered by the light of reason, are nothing else
   than the reflected light of divine revelation; for how else can you
   account for it, that the theory and moral system of our sober deists,
   should be so much superior to the attainments of Socrates, Plato, and
   Cicero? Their conduct resembles that of a man, who should light his
   taper by means of the sun's rays, and then pretend that all the light
   around him, he had struck out himself; or, that it was produced by the
   feeble taper which he held in his hand.

   But, to return to the point under discussion. If a man, now he is a
   sinner, can certainly know that the punishment of his sins can be
   evaded by a repentance. completely in his own power, he could also know
   this before he sinned. Then, with the law written on his heart, and
   sanctioned with a penalty, he had the clear knowledge from reason, that
   commit whatever atrocious sins he might, and incur whatever punishment
   he might, that he would at any, and at every moment of his existence,
   have it in his power, to escape all the punishment which he had
   merited, simply by the act of repentance. This is a plain and fair
   statement of the case; and it is easy to see, that it is completely
   subversive of the law of God, as a binding rule; and leaves it fully in
   the power of the creature to do whatever he pleases. He may
   deliberately determine, that he will rebel against his Maker, till the
   last moment of life, and then disarm his vengeance, by repentance. The
   penalty of the law may be in itself, tremendous, but it can deter no
   one from any course which he may be inclined to pursue, because, he
   can, at any moment, remove himself from its operation. What greater
   license could the most daring rebel wish, than what is thus granted?
   This single principle admitted into the moral government of God, would
   be a complete nullification of the divine authority.

   These consequences of the doctrine under consideration, are evident and
   inevitable, and demonstrate that it cannot be a principle of reason, or
   natural religion. But it may be thought by some, that the same
   objection will lie, with all its force, against the doctrine of the
   Gospel, which promises a plenary pardon to every true penitent. But
   this is a mistake: the evangelical doctrine of repentance stands on
   entirely different grounds. That such an offer would be made, could be
   known by no creature before he sinned. This doctrine does not in the
   least clash with the justice of God; for all the sins of the penitent,
   to which pardon is granted, are virtually and actually punished in the
   sinners substitute. Here is the grand point of difference between
   Christianity, and deism and all other systems. The former maintains the
   glory and harmony of all the divine attributes; the latter obscures, or
   would destroy one attribute, to make way for another. The consequence
   is, that the way in which pardon is granted to the penitent, according
   to the Gospel, has no tendency to relax our obligation to obedience, or
   to lessen our sense of the evil of sin; but the deistical principle of
   forgiveness, as we have seen, nullifies the law and authority of the
   Governor of the universe; and leaves it completely at the option of the
   creature, whether he will obey or transgress the law of God. The former
   is perfectly consistent with the justice of God, extending pardon to no
   sin for which satisfaction has not been made; while the latter is in
   direct repugnance to the clearest demands of justice.

   But another objection to the opinion that the punishment of sin is
   remitted upon repentance, is, that this is contrary to experience, and
   fact. We have seen that the deist is fond of considering the punishment
   of win as being nothing else but its consequences, arising out of the
   laws of nature. Is it true, then, that the laws of nature change their
   course as soon as a sinner repents? Is it not a fact, that the penitent
   thief, in the penitentiary, and the repentant debauches, in the
   hospital, are still suffering the consequences of their crimes, long
   since committed? Repentance cannot bring back lost health, ruined
   reputation, dissipated fortune, and alienated friends. How then, can
   the deist, on his own principles, pretend, that the punishment of sin
   is removed by repentance? He may allege, that the future punishment of
   sin will be remitted; but how does he know this? reason can judge
   nothing in regard to the future, but by some analogy with what is
   observed to take place in this life; and from the facts stated, it is
   manifest, that all analogy is against the opinion, that the evil
   consequences of sin will be terminated by death.

   Again, if pardon be granted only to the penitent; and the impenitent be
   punished according to the demerit of their crimes, then there is a
   state of sinning which renders it proper that sin should be punished
   rigidly according to its desert. There can, therefore, be no argument
   drawn from the goodness and compassion of God, against the condign
   punishment of sinners. But why is impenitence alone to be considered as
   exposing a sinner to the wrath of God? And why are the penitent alone,
   exempt from the penalty of the law? The answer must be, either, that
   the sin of impenitence is so great as to deserve this severe treatment;
   or, the merit of repentance is such as to atone for the greatest sins,
   which man can commit. But supposing that impenitence draws after it
   deeper guilt than all other sins, this does not prove that this alone
   should be punished; it only proves, that it should be punished more:
   but if there be a plain principle in jurisprudence, it is, that every
   sin should certainly be visited with punishment, but exactly according
   to its' nature. There is no reason why a less sin should be suffered to
   pass rather than a greater. Strict justice says, let every sin have its
   due retribution. The greatness of the sin of impenitence, therefore,
   cannot be a reason why the impenitent alone are to be punished. Nor can
   this great difference in the treatment of sinners, be owing to the
   merit of repentance; for it would be difficult to tell, wherein its
   most extraordinary merit consisted. It must either be in the obedience,
   or the suffering involved in the exercise of repentance. But it cannot
   consist in the degree of obedience which it contains; for, if this were
   perfect, it could do no more than answer the demands of the moral law,
   for the time being, but could have no effect on sins already committed.
   I think it a self-evident truth, that my obedience, this moment, cannot
   atone, or satify, for my disobedience, the preceding moment; for in the
   latter case, I do no more than my duty. Then, certainly, the obedience
   included in repentance cannot atone for all past sins, however
   enormous, for it is imperfect; and, moreover, has nothing in it which
   enhances its value, above other acts of obedience. Neither can the
   suffering involved in repentance atone for past sins; for, these pangs
   of compunction owe all their virtue to the obedience with which they
   are connected, and without which they would not even be of a moral
   nature. Unless some one should be of opinion, that these penitential
   sorrows are to be considered as an equivalent for the penalty of the
   law: but this cannot be correct, because an equivalent for the penalty
   of the law, would be an equal degree and duration of suffering. If,
   indeed, a person of higher dignity and greater worth is permitted to
   suffer in the place of another, in proportion to the difference in
   dignity, the sufferings may be diminished. It is, however, always a
   matter in the breast of the Supreme Judge, whether to allow of such a
   substitution. I see nothing unreasonable in it. But in the case under
   inquiry, the same person who owes the suffering, if I may so speak,
   endures the sorrows of repentance; and how, I would ask, can the pious
   grief of a few hours or days, be an equivalent for the punishment of
   the most heinous transgressions? Besides, the penitent sinner ever
   feels, and is ready to confess, that he deserves further punishment. No
   one who ever truly repented entertained the idea, that by this, he had
   made a complete atonement for his sins. These stains are of too deep a
   dye, to be washed out by a few penitential tears. Nothing can be more
   opposed to this opinion, than the views and feelings, involved in the
   exercises of true repentance. Every true penitent is deeply convinced,
   that he deserves heavier punishment, than what is involved in the
   sorrows which he now experiences.

   There is, however, one ground for the opinion, that there is a
   reasonable connexion between repentance and forgiveness, which is,
   perhaps, more plausible than any other argument; and therefore merits a
   distinct consideration. It is, that all good men acknowledge, that it
   is a virtue to forgive those who offend us, when they appear to be
   penitent; and Christians cannot deny that this is a part of moral duty,
   for it is repeatedly and emphatically enjoined, in the New Testament,
   as a thing essential. What is here alleged, we fully admit; and are
   willing to go farther, and say, that it is made the duty of Christians
   to forgive those who injure them, whether they repent or not; for they
   are required to "love their enemies; to do good to them that hate them;
   to bless them that curse them; and pray for them which despitefully use
   them." But this is entirely a distinct case, and resting on principles
   entirely different, from the one under consideration. It is no part of
   the duty of Christians to inflict condign punishment on those who sin,
   even if they have been injured by them. They are forbidden to seek for
   revenge, or to render to the wicked according to their iniquities; not
   because there is any thing improper or inconsistent with moral
   goodness, in punishing the guilty as they deserve; but because this is
   the peculiar prerogative of the Governor of the universe. In those very
   passages of Scripture, where vengeance is forbidden to the creature, in
   express and emphatical language it is claimed for the Almighty.
   "Vengeance is mine, I will repay saith the Lord; therefore, if thine
   enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst give him drink, for in so doing
   thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head." If this duty of
   forgiveness, in the Christian, proved any thing, it would prove more
   than is wished; it would follow, that God would certainly pardon not
   only the penitent, but all sinners, however obstinate in their
   rebellion. But this conclusion is altogether at variance with the
   opinion which we have had under discussion, and is not even held up by
   the deist.

   Another argument in favor of the doctrine that repentance is naturally
   connected with pardon, is derived from the practice of granting pardon,
   in human governments. But here, there is a mistake respecting the real
   state of the fact; for, although, it is true, that in all human
   governments, it is found expedient, to have a pardoning power, lodged
   somewhere; yet, no government ever yet professed to act on the
   principle of pardoning all offences, on the condition of repentance:
   nor, indeed, is the extension of mercy to certain criminals who have
   incurred the penalty of the law, at all connected with this principle.
   The reason why it is sometimes right to pardon offences against the
   state, is, either because in some particular case, the rigid execution
   of law would not be entirely just; or, that on account of the number of
   persons implicated, sound policy may dictate, that only the most guilty
   should be held up as an example. It appears, then, that the weakness of
   human governments is the ground on which the penalty of the law is
   remitted; but no such reason can exist in the divine government. But,
   in the execution of human laws, no inquiry is ever instituted, whether
   the criminal be penitent: yea, although his repentance should be most
   evident, yet this never disarms the law of its penalty. The penitent
   thief or murderer, are punished by our laws, as well as the obstinate
   and impenitent. If, in a few cases, rulers who possessed the power of
   granting pardon, have acted on the principle, that criminals who
   discovered signs of penitence, should be, on that account, pardoned, it
   only proves, that men entrusted with power may be misled; for
   undoubtedly, this principle carried out, would soon be subversive of
   all law. If the only end of punishment was the good of the culprit,
   then, indeed, such a course might be defended; but as long as the good
   of the community is the chief end of punishment, it never can be safe
   to offer pardon to all who profess repentance; or who, for a while,
   appear to be reformed.

   I think it is manifest, from the preceding discussion, that the idea of
   a certain connexion between repentance and pardon, in the moral
   government of God, is not derived from the light of nature, but from
   the Gospel; and, therefore, if pardon is to be had in this way, it is
   only on the ground of the atonement of Christ; and not on account of
   any merit or efficacy in repentance, to take away the guilt of sin.

   And if these views are correct, then is a divine revelation absolutely
   necessary to teach us, that God is willing to receive the penitent into
   favor; and to inform us, on what terms this is practicable.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V.

   THERE IS NOTHING IMPROBABLE OR UNREASONABLE IN THE IDEA OF A REVELATION
   FROM GOD; AND CONSEQUENTLY, NOTHING IMPROBABLE OR UNREASONABLE IN SUCH
   A MANIFEST DIVINE INTERPOSITION, AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A
   REVELATION.

   THAT a revelation is possible, will not be called in question by any
   who believe in the existance of a God; nor can it be believed that
   there is any thing in the notion of a revelation, repugnant to the
   moral attributes of the Supreme Being. It cannot be inconsistent with
   the wisdom, goodness, or holiness of God, to increase the knowledge of
   his intelligent creatures. The whole end of a revelation is to make men
   wiser, better, and happier; and what can be conceived more accordant
   with our ideas of divine perfection, than this?

   That man is capable of receiving benefit from a revelation, is a truth
   so evident, that it would be folly to spend time in demonstrating it;
   for whatever may be thought of the sufficiency of Natural Religion, if
   it was fully understood and improved; yet all must admit, that men,
   generally, have not been sufficiently enlightened on the subject of
   religion. The history of the world, in all ages, proves the deplorable
   ignorance of the greater part of the human race, even on those
   subjects, which the advocates of Natural Religion, confess to be most
   important and fundamental, as has been proved in the preceding chapter.

   It cannot be thought an unreasonable supposition, that when God made
   the original progenitors of our race, he should furnish them with such
   knowledge as was absolutely necessary, not only for their comfort, but
   for their preservation. As they were without experience, and had none
   upon earth from whom they could derive instruction, is it unreasonable
   to suppose, that the beneficent Creator communicated to them such a
   stock of knowledge, as was requisite for the common purposes of life?
   The theory of those who suppose, that man was at first a dumb,
   irrational animal, very little different from those which now roam the
   forest;--and that from this state lie emerged by his own
   exertions;--that he invented articulate speech, and all the arts of
   life, without ever receiving any aid, or any revelation from his
   Creator, has already been sufficiently refuted.

   If, then, man received, at first, such ideas as were necessary to his
   condition, this was a revelation; and if afterwards he should at any
   time need information, on any subject connected with his happiness, why
   might not the benevolent Creator, who does not abandon the work of his
   hands, again vouchsafe to make a communication to him? Such an
   exigency, deists themselves being judges, did arise. Men, almost
   universally, fell into the practice of idolatry, and lost the knowledge
   of the true God. They betook themselves to the worship of the
   luminaries of heaven, of dead men, of beasts, and inanimate things.
   They invented superstitious rites, not only irrational, but cruel and
   abominable. These were transmitted from generation to generation; and
   the children became still more involved in ignorance, than their
   parents. Now, that the righteous Governor of the universe may leave men
   to follow their own inventions, and suffer by their own folly, is
   certain; for he has done so. But is it not consistent with his wisdom
   and goodness to use extraordinary means to rescue them from a state so
   degraded and wretched? Would not every sober deist admit, that some
   means of bringing them back to just ideas of Natural Religion would be
   desirable? If then the apostacy of man from his Maker should render
   some farther revelation necessary, would it not be highly benevolent to
   communicate whatever knowledge his circumstances required? Why would it
   be thought unreasonable, that God should sometimes depart from his
   common mode of acting, to answer great and valuable ends? What is there
   in the established course of nature so sacred or so immutable, that it
   must never on any occasion or for any purpose be changed? The only
   reason why the laws of nature are uniform, is, that this is for the
   benefit of man, but if his interest requires a departure from the
   regular course, what is there to render it unreasonable? The Author of
   the universe has never hound himself to pursue one undeviating course,
   in the government of the world. The time may come when he may think
   proper to change the whole system. As he gave it a beginning, he may
   also give it an end. General uniformity is expedient, that men may know
   what to expect, and may have encouragement to use means to obtain
   necessary ends; but occasional and unfrequent deviations from this
   uniformity have no tendency to prevent the benefit arising from it.
   This is so evident a truth that I am almost ashamed to dwell so long
   upon it; but by the sophistry of infidels a strange darkness has been
   thrown over the subject, so that it seems to be thought that there
   would be something immoral, or unwise and inconsistent, in contravening
   the laws of nature.

   Let it be remembered that the object here is not to prove that there
   must be a revelation; it is only to show that there would be nothing
   unreasonable in the thing; and farther, that it would be a very
   desirable thing for man, and altogether consistent with the perfections
   of God, and the principles on which he governs the world.

   If God should determine to reveal his will to man, how could this be
   most conveniently effected? We can conceive of two ways. The first, by
   inspiring all who needed knowledge with the ideas which he wished to
   communicate. The second, by inspiring a few persons, and directing them
   to make known to others the truths received. The first would seem to be
   the most effectual, but the last is mose analogous to his other
   dispensations. Reason might have been given in perfection at once, and
   not left to the uncertainty of education and human improvement; but
   such is not the fact. By slow degrees and much culture this faculty
   attains its maturity, and when neglected never acquires any high degree
   of strength. In regard to the best mode of making a revelation,
   however, we are totally incompetent to judge; but of one thing we may
   be certain, that if God should give a revelation to men, he would so
   attest it as to enable all sincere inquirers to know that it derives
   its origin from him; for otherwise it would be useless, as there would
   be no evidence of its truth. Supposing a revelation to be given, what
   would be a satisfactory attestation of its divine origin? It must be
   some sign or evidence not capable of being counterfeited; something by
   which God should in some way manifest himself. And how could this be
   effected, but by the exertion of his power or the manifestation of his
   infinite knowledge? That is, by miracles, or by prophecies, or by both.
   There is then just as much probability that miracles will exist, (for
   prophecy may be considered one kind of miracle) as that a revelation
   will he given. The conjunction of these two things is reasonable; if we
   find the one, we may be sure the other exists also.

   It is admitted that a revelation from God would have internal evidence
   of its origin, but this does not strike the attention at once. It
   requires time before it can be perceived; but in the first
   establishment of a revelation, there is need of some evidence which is
   obvious to the senses and level to the capacities of all. Just such an
   evidence are miracles. Moreover, internal evidence requires, in order
   that it may be perceived and appreciated, a certain favourable state of
   the moral feeling, without which it is apt to be overlooked, and
   produces no conviction; whereas external evidence is not only level to
   every capacity, but adapted to bring home conviction to every
   description of men, to the bad as well as the good.

   Miracles then furnish the best proof for the establishment of a
   revelation. They seem to be its proper seal. They are the manifest
   attestation of God. Nothing can be conceived which will more strikingly
   indicate his power and presence than a visible suspension of the laws
   of nature. He is invisible: he must make himself known by his works,
   and a miracle is such a work as no other can perform. When therefore a
   person professes to have received a revelation from God, and when we
   behold the effects of Almighty power accompanying his words, all are
   sure that God is with him, and that he is a teacher sent from God; for
   otherwise he could never perform such wonderful works; or rather, to
   speak more correctly, God would never exert his power to confirm the
   pretensions of an impostor or to attest doctrines which are not true.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI.

   MIRACLES ARE CAPABLE OF PROOF FROM TESTIMONY.

   I do not know that any one has denied that a miracle would be credible,
   if exhibited to our senses. A man might, indeed, be deceived by an
   illusion arising from some disorder in his senses; but if he was
   conscious of being in a sound state of body and mind, and should
   witness not only one, but a variety of miracles; not only a few times,
   but for years, in succession; and, if he should find, that all around
   him had the same perceptions of these facts as himself, I need not say,
   that it would be reasonable to credit his senses, for the constitution
   of his nature would leave him no choice: he would be under the
   necessity of believing, what he saw with his eyes, heard with ears, and
   handled with his hands. But are there facts which a man would credit on
   the evidence of his senses, which can, by no means, be rendered
   credible by the testimony of any number of witnesses? Then there might
   be facts, the knowledge of which could never be so communicated as to
   be worthy of credit. According to this hypothesis, the constitution of
   our nature would require us to withhold our assent from what was true,
   and from what others knew to be true. If a thousand persons of the
   strictest veracity should testify, that they had repeatedly witnessed a
   miracle, and if all circumstances should concur to corroborate their
   testimony, yet upon this principle it would be unreasonable to credit
   them; even if they should consent to die in confirmation of what they
   declared to be the fact. This is the ground taken by Mr. Hume, in his
   boasted argument against miracles. But, it appears to me, that every
   man, previously to examination, must be convinced that it is false; for
   it is contrary to common sense, and universal experience of the effect
   of testimony. The true principle on this subject, is, that any fact
   which would be believed on the evidence of the senses, may be
   reasonably believed on testimony. For there may be testimony of such a
   nature, as to produce conviction as strong as any other conceivable
   evidence; and such testimony in favor of a miracle, would establish it
   as firmly as if we had witnessed it ourselves. But, notwithstanding
   this is the conclusion of common sense and experience, the metaphysical
   argument of Mr. Hume has had the effect of perplexing and unsettling
   the minds of many: and as he boasts, that "it will be useful to
   overthrow-miracles as long as the world endures," it seems necessary to
   enter into an examination of his argument, that we may be able to
   expose its fallacy. This has already been done, in a convincing manner,
   by several men, [5] eminent for their learning and discrimination: and
   if their works were read by all who peruse Hume, I should think it
   unnecessary to add a single word on the subject. But it may not be
   without use, to present a refutation, in a condensed form, for the sake
   of those who will not take the trouble to go through a minute and
   extended demonstration.

   The argument of Mr. Hume will be best exhibited in his own words. "A
   miracle," says he, "supported by any human testimony, is more properly
   a subject of derision, than of argument. No testimony for any kind of
   miracle can ever possibly amount to a probability."--"We establish it
   as a maxim, that no human testimony can have such force, as to prove a
   miracle, and make a just foundation for any system of religion."--"Our
   belief or assurance of any fact from the report of eye witnesses, is
   derived from no other principle, than experience; that is, our
   observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual
   conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. Now, if the fact
   attested partakes of the marvellous, if it is such as has seldom fallen
   under our own observation; here is a contest of two opposite
   experiences, of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force
   goes. Further, if the fact affirmed by the witness, instead of being
   only marvellous, is really miraculous; if, besides, the testimony
   considered apart, and in itself, amounts to an entire proof; in that
   case there is proof against proof; of which the strongest must prevail.
   A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and
   unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a
   miracle from the very nature of the fact is as entire as any argument
   from experience can possibly be imagined. And if so, it is an
   undeniable consequence, that it cannot be surmounted by any proof
   whatever from testimony. A miracle, therefore, however attested, can
   never be rendered credible, even in the lowest degree."

   Here we have the substance of Mr. Hume's argument, on which I propose
   to make some remarks, intended to show that its whole plausibility
   depends on the assumption of false principles and the artful use of
   equivocal terms.

   1. Some prejudice is created in the mind of the Unsuspecting reader, by
   the definition of a miracle here given. It is called "a violation of
   the laws of nature," which carries with it an unfavorable idea, as
   though some obligation was violated, and some injury was done. But the
   simple truth is, that the laws of nature are nothing else than the
   common operations of divine power, in the government of the world,
   which depend entirely, for their existence and continuance, on the
   divine will; and a miracle is nothing else, than the exertion of the
   same power in a way different from that which is common; or, it may be
   a mere suspension of that power, which is commonly observed to operate
   in the world.

   2. Mr. Hume's argument will apply to the evidence of the senses as well
   as to that derived from testimony, and will prove (if it prove any
   thing) that it would be impossible to believe in a miracle, if we
   should witness it ever so often. "The very same principle of
   experience," says he, "which gives us a certain degree of assurance in
   the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree
   of assurance against the fact which they endeavor to establish, from
   which contradiction there arises necessarily a counterpoise, and mutual
   destruction of belief and authority." The very same counterpoise and
   mutual destruction of belief, must also occur between the assurance
   derived from the senses, and that derived from experience. The reason
   why testimony cannot be believed in favor of a miracle, is not,
   according to Mr. Hume, because it has no force; for taken by itself, it
   may be sufficient to produce assurance; but let this assurance be as
   strong as it may, it cannot be stronger than that derived from
   universal experience. "In that case," says he--"there is proof against
   proof." Now, it is evident, that upon these principles, the same
   equilibrium from contradictory evidence, must take place, between
   experience and the senses. If one evidence be stronger than another,
   "the stronger must prevail, but with a diminution of force in
   proportion to that of its antagonist." But in the case of the senses,
   and a firm and unalterable experience, the evidence is perfect on both
   sides, so that the "counterpoise and mutual destruction of belief,"
   must occur. According to this metaphysical balance of Mr. Hume, a
   miracle could not be believed if we witnessed it ever so often; for
   although there is a great weight of evidence on each side, yet as there
   is an equilibrium, neither can have any influence on our assent.
   Whether Mr. Hume would have objected to this conclusion, does not
   appear; but it is manifest, that it logically follows from his
   argument, as much as in the case to. which he has applied it. And here
   we see to what a pitch of skepticism his reasoning leads.

   3. Mr. Hume makes an unnecessary distinction between that which is
   marvellous, and that which is miraculous; for although there is a real
   difference, yet as to his argument, there is none. The force of his
   reasoning does not relate to events as being miraculous, but as being
   opposite to universal experience. If the conclusion, therefore, be
   correct, it will equally prove, that no testimony is sufficient to
   establish a natural event, which has not before been experienced. If
   ever so many witnesses should aver, that they had seen meteoric stones
   fall from the clouds, or the galvanic fluid melt metals, yet if we have
   never experienced these things ourselves, we must not believe them.

   4. The opposite or contrary experience of Mr. Hume, in regard to
   miracles, can mean nothing more, than that such things have not been
   experienced. There is no other opposite experience conceivable, in this
   case, unless a number of persons present, at the same time, should
   experience opposite impressions. The distinction which he artfully
   makes, in relation to "the king of Siam, who refused to believe the
   first reports concerning the effects of frost," between that which is
   contrary to experience, and not conformable to experience, is without
   foundation. For a fact cannot be contrary to experience in any other
   way, than by being not conformable to it. There neither is, nor can be,
   any experience against miracles, except this, that they have not
   occurred in our own experience or that of others. When the proposition
   of our author is expressed in language free from ambiguity, it will
   amount to this, that what has never been experienced, can never be
   believed on any testimony; than which nothing can easily be conceived
   more false. In what a situation must man have been, at the beginning of
   the world, if he had adopted the principles of this skeptic.

   5. Mr. Hume uses the word experience in a twofold sense, changing from
   one to the other, as best suits his purpose. Sometimes it means,
   personal experience, and at other times, and more commonly, the
   experience of the whole world. Now, if it be taken to mean our own
   individual experience, the argument will be, that no fact which we
   ourselves have not witnessed, can be established by testimony; which,
   if correct, would cut off, at a stroke, the greater part of human
   knowledge. Much the most numerous class of facts are those which we
   receive upon the testimony of others, and many of these are entirely
   different from any thing that we have personally experienced. Many
   learned men never take the trouble to witness the most curious
   experiments in philosophy, and chemistry; yet they are as well
   satisfied of their truth, as if they had personal experience of it.

   But although an argument founded on an opposition between testimony and
   experience, in order to be of any validity, must relate to personal
   experience; yet, Mr. Hume commonly uses the term to signify the
   experience of all men in all ages. This extensive meaning of the term
   must be the one which be affixes to it in most places of his essay;
   because, it is an experience by which we know that the laws of nature
   are uniform and unalterable; and he has given an example which clearly
   determines the sense of the word,. "That a dead man should come to
   life," says he, "has never been witnessed in any age or country." Now,
   according to this use of the word, what he calls an argument, is a mere
   assumption of the point in dispute; what logicians call, a petitio
   principii;--a begging of the question. For, what is the question in.
   debate? is it not whether miracles have ever been experienced? And how
   does Mr. Hume undertake to prove that they never did exist? By an
   argument intended to demonstrate that no testimony can establish them;
   the main principle of which argument is, that all experience is against
   them. if miracles have ever occurred, they are not contrary to
   universal experience; for whatever has been witnessed at any time, by
   any person, makes part of universal experience. What sort of reasoning
   is it, then, to form an argument against the truth of miracles, founded
   on the assumption, that they never existed? if it be true, as he says,
   "That it has never been witnessed, in any age or country, that a dead
   man should come to life," then, indeed, it is useless to adduce
   testimony to prove, that the dead have, on some occasions, been brought
   to life. If he had a right to take this for granted, where was the use
   of such a parade of reasoning on the subject of testimony? The very
   conclusion to which he wished to come, is here assumed, as the main
   principle in the argument. It is, however, as easy to deny as to
   affirm; and we do utterly deny the truth of this position; so, that
   after all, we are at issue, precisely on the point, where we commenced.
   Nothing is proved by the argument which promised so much, except the
   skill of the writer in sophistical reasoning.

   6. Our author falls into another mistake in his reasoning. The object
   is to prove, that testimony in favor of miracles, can never produce
   conviction, because it is opposed by uniform and unalterable
   experience. But how do we know what this universal experience is? Is it
   not by testimony, except within the narrow circle of our own personal
   experience? Then it turns out, that the testimony in favor of miracles
   is neutralized or overbalanced, by other testimony. That is, to destroy
   the force of testimony, he assumes a principle founded on testimony. It
   is admitted, that when testimony is adduced to establish any facts, if
   other and stronger testimony can be brought against them, their
   credibility is destroyed. But. if I bring testimony for a fact, and
   some One alleges that he can show that this testimony is unworthy of
   credit, because he can bring witnesses to prove that many persons in
   different countries and ages never saw any such thing; to such a person
   I would reply, that even if these witnesses declared the truth, it
   could not overthrow the positive testimony which I had adduced, as they
   did not contradict the facts asserted; and, besides, it must be
   determined, which witnesses are the most credible, yours or mine. Just
   so it is in the case of Mr. Hume's argument. He sets up uniform
   experience against testimony, and gives a preponderance to the former,
   on the ground, that witnesses are known sometimes to lie; but all that
   he knows of what has happened in other ages-and countries, is by
   testimony; and they who give this testimony are as fallible as others;
   therefore, there existed no ground for prefering the evidence of
   experience, to testimony. Besides, he is not in possession of testimony
   to establish a thousandth part of what has been experienced; and as far
   as it goes, it amounts to no more than non-experience; a mere negative
   thing, which can never have any weight to overthrow the testimony of
   positive witnesses. In a court of justice, such a method of rebutting
   testimony, would be rejected as totally inadmissible. If we had
   sufficient evidence of a fact of any kind, that testimony would not be
   invalidated, if it could be proved, that no person in the world had
   ever witnessed the like before. This want of previous experience
   naturally creates a presumption against the fact, which requires some
   force of evidence to overcome: but in all cases, a sufficient number of
   witnesses, of undoubted intelligence and veracity, will be able to
   remove the presumption, and produce conviction.

   7. Mr. Hume lays it down as a principle, that our belief in testimony
   arises from "experience; that is, observation of the veracity of human
   testimony." But this is not correct. Our belief in testimony is as
   natural and constitutional, as our belief in our senses. Children, at
   first, believe implicitly all that is told them: and it is from
   experience that they learn to distrust testimony. If our faith in
   testimony arose from experience, it would be impossible to acquire any
   knowledge from instruction. If children were to believe nothing that
   was told them, until they had made observations on the veracity of
   human testimony, nothing would ever be believed; for they would never
   arrive at the maturity and judgment necessary to make observations on a
   subject so complicated.

   But although, I perceive, Mr. Hume's object in wishing to establish
   this false principle, was, to exalt the evidence of what he calls
   experience, above testimony; yet, I think, if we should concede it to
   him, it could answer him no purpose, since we have shown, that this
   experience itself, depends on testimony. Whatever use he can make, of
   this principle, therefore, against testimony, can be turned against
   himself, since his knowledge of what the experience of the world is,
   can only be obtained by the report of witnesses, who, in different
   ages, have observed the course of nature.

   8. Mr. Hume, on reflection, seems to have been convinced, that his
   argument was unsound; for in a note, appended to his Essay on Miracles,
   he makes a concession, which entirely overthrows the whole. But mark
   the disingenuity, or shall I not rather call it, the malignity of the
   man, against religion, which is manifested in this only evidence of his
   candor. He concedes that there may be miracles of such a kind, as to
   admit of proof from human testimony, in direct contradiction to his
   reiterated maxim, and in complete repugnance to all his reasoning; but.
   he makes the concession with the express reservation, that it shall not
   be applied to the support of religion. He, however, not only makes this
   concession, but gives an example of such miracles, and of the testimony
   which he admits to be sufficient to establish it. "Suppose," says he,
   "all authors in all languages agree, that from the first of January,
   1600, there was a total darkness all over the earth for eight days;
   suppose that the tradition of this event is still strong and lively
   among the people; that all travellers bring us accounts of the same
   tradition, &c.--IT IS EVIDENT THAT OUR PHILOSOPHERS OUGHT TO RECEIVE IT
   FOR CERTAIN." And this is a part of the same Essay, in which it is
   said, "That a miracle, supported by any human testimony, is more
   properly a subject of derision than argument." "No kind of testimony
   for any kind of miracle can possibly amount to a probability, much less
   to a proof."

   It might appear, that after so complete a renunciation of the principle
   which at first he so strenuously asserted, we might have spared
   ourselves the pains of a formal refutation. But not so. The author is
   resolved, that his concession shall be of no service, whatever, to
   religion. Hear his own words: "But should this miracle be ascribed to
   any new system of religion; men in all ages have been so imposed upon
   by ridiculous stories of that kind, that this very circumstance would
   be full proof of a cheat, and sufficient with all men of sense, not
   only to make them reject the fact, but even reject it, without further
   examination." I have heard of a maxim, which, I believe, the Jesuits
   introduced, that, that might be true in philosophy, which was false in
   theology; but I never could have expected that a philosopher, a
   logician, and a metaphysician too, would utter any thing so
   unreasonable, and so marked with prejudice, as the declaration just
   quoted. The fact was admitted to have such evidence, that. even
   philosophers ought to receive it as certain. But not if it is ascribed
   to a new religion. On this subject no evidence is sufficient. It is
   perfectly unexceptionable in philosophy; but in religion a sensible man
   will reject it, whatever it may be; even without further examination.
   The. circumstance of its being a miracle connected with religion, is
   sufficient, in his opinion, to prove it a cheat, however complete the
   testimony. The world, it seems, has been so imposed on by ridiculous
   stories of this kind, that we must not even listen to any testimony in
   favor of religious miracles. This author would, indeed, reduce the
   advocates of religion to an awkward dilemma. They are called upon to
   produce evidence for their religion, but if they adduce it, sensible
   men will not notice it; even if it is good every where else, it must go
   for nothing in religion. Upon these principles, we might indeed give up
   the contest; but we are not willing to admit that this is sound logic,
   or good sense. The reason assigned for proscribing, in this summary
   way, all the testimony in favor of religion, will apply to other
   subjects. Men have been imposed on by ridiculous stories in philosophy,
   as well as in religion; but when evidence is proposed, shall we not
   even examine it, because there have been impositions? This is the very
   reason why we should examine with care, that we may distinguish between
   the true and the false.

   If it were true, that miracles had often been ascribed to new
   religions, it would not prove that there never were any true miracles,
   but rather the contrary; just as the abounding of counterfeit money is
   evidence that there is some genuine; for that which has no existence is
   not counterfeited. But the clamor that has been raised by infidels
   about new religions being commonly founded on miracles, or the pretence
   of miracles, has very little foundation in fact. Besides the Jewish and
   Christian religions, (which are indeed parts of the same,) it would, I
   believe, be difficult to designate any other, which claims such an
   origin.

   After all that has been said of the false maxims of the Jesuits, I
   doubt whether any one could be selected so perfectly at war with
   reason, as this of the Scotch philosopher: nay, I think, I may
   challenge all the enemies of revelation, to cull from any Christian
   writer, a sentence, so surcharged with prejudice.

   But, to do justice to Mr. Hume--although he seems to have closed the
   door against all discussion, on our part--yet, in one of his general
   maxims, he leaves us one alternative. The maxim is this, "That no
   testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless it be of such a
   kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact." An
   ingenious writer [6] has undertaken to meet Mr. Hume on his own ground;
   and has endeavored to prove, that the testimony of the apostles and
   early Christians, if the facts reported by them were true, is a greater
   miracle than any which they have recorded. But the maxim, as stated by
   Mr. Hume, is not correct. With the change of a single word, perhaps, it
   may be adopted, and will place the question on its proper ground. The
   change which I propose, is to substitute the word improbable, for
   miraculous. And it will then read, No testimony is sufficient to
   establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its
   falsehood would be. more improbable, than the fact which it endeavors
   to establish. The ground of objection to the word miraculous, is, that
   it involves a false principle, which is, that facts are incredible in
   proportion as they are miraculous; which principle, he, in several
   places avows, and which is, indeed, a cardinal point in his system of
   evidence. But it is not true. There are many cases which might be
   proposed, in which, of two events, one of which must be true, that
   which is miraculous is more probable than the one which is merely
   natural. I will mention only one at present. Man was either immediately
   created by God, or he proceeded from some natural cause. Need I ask,
   which of these is most probable? and yet the first is miraculous; the
   second not. The plain truth is, that in all cases, the fact which has
   most evidence is most probable, whether it be miraculous or natural.
   And when all evidence, relating to a proposition, is before the mind,
   THAT IS TRUE, WHICH IS EASIEST TO BE BELIEVED; because it is easier to
   believe with evidence, than against it.

   We are willing, therefore, that this maxim, as now stated, should be
   the ground of our decision, and we pledge ourselves to prove, that, the
   falsehood of the miracles of the Gospel, would be more improbable, and
   consequently more incredible, than the truth of the facts recorded in
   them. But this discussion will be reserved for another place. To
   conclude; since, it has been shown, that there is no antecedent
   presumption against miracles from the nature of God, or from the laws
   by which he governs the universe;--since, a miraculous fact is not more
   difficult to be accomplished by omnipotence, than any other;--since,
   miracles are no further improbable, than as they are unusual;--since,
   they are the most suitable and decisive evidences which can be given of
   a revelation;--since, even by the concession of Mr. Hume himself, there
   may be sufficient testimony fully to establish them:--and, since, the
   many false pretences to miracles, and the general disposition to credit
   them, are rather proofs that they have existed, than the contrary; we
   may safely conclude, that Mr. Hume's argument, on this subject, is
   sophistical and delusive; and that it is so far from being true, as he
   alleges, that they are incredible, whatever may be their evidence, when
   brought to support religion, that this is, of all others, that
   department, in which they are most reasonable and credible.

   CHAPTER VII.

   `THE MIRACLES OF THE GOSPEL ARE CREDIBLE.

   HAVING shown, in the preceding chapter, that miracles may be so
   attested as to be credible, I come now to examine the evidence by which
   the miraculous facts recorded in the New Testament, may be established.

   This is the main point in our inquiry; for, after all that has been
   said, it must be admitted, that unless the Christian religion is
   attended with sufficient evidence, we cannot believe in it, even if we
   would.

   Before entering directly on this discussion, it may be useful to
   premise a few things respecting the nature and force of testimony,
   which, it is presumed, will be admitted by all who have attended to the
   subject.

   This species of evidence admits of all conceivable degrees, from the
   weakest probability to the fullest assurance; for while, on this
   ground, we yield to some reports, the most hesitating assent, we are as
   certainly persuaded of others, as of those things which we perceive by
   our senses, or have demonstrated by mathematical reasoning.

   The exact force of testimony cannot be calculated by rule, nor
   estimated by reason; but is known, only from experience. Many things
   are believed on testimony, with the most unwavering confidence, when we
   are utterly unable to explain the precise ground on which our
   conviction rests. The sources of our information have been so numerous,
   and the same facts presented to us in so many forms, that it is
   impossible to attribute to each its influence in gaining our assent. If
   we were asked, on what particular testimony we believe there is such a
   place as Rome, or why we believe that such a person as Buonaparte
   lately figured in Europe, we could only answer, in the general, that
   multiplied testimonies of these facts, had reached us, so that all
   possibility of doubting was excluded. The same assurance, and resting
   on the same grounds, is experienced in relation to facts, which
   occurred in ages (; long past. Who can bring himself to doubt, whether
   such persons as Julius Cæsar, Paul, Mohammed, Columbus, or Luther, ever
   existed?

   When we have obtained evidence to a certain amount, nothing is gained
   by the admission of more. The mind becomes, as it were, saturated, and
   no increase of conviction is produced, by multiplying witnesses. One
   sound demonstration of a theorem in mathematics, is as good as a
   hundred. A few upright witnesses who agree, and are uncontradicted by
   other evidence, are as satisfactory as any conceivable number. On a
   trial for murder, if there were a thousand witnesses who could attest
   the fact, a judicious court would not deem it necessary to examine more
   than half a dozen, or at most, a dozen, if there were a perfect
   agreement in their testimony. Experience only can inform us, what
   degree of evidence will produce complete conviction; but we may judge
   from former experience, what will be the effect of the same evidence,
   in future: and from the effect on our own minds, what it will be on the
   minds of others.

   Testimony, not of the strongest kind, may be so corroborated by
   circumstances, and especially by the existing consequences of the facts
   reported, that it may be rendered credible, and even irresistible.
   Should a historian of doubtful credit attest, that an eclipse of the
   sun occured, on a certain day, and was visible in a certain place; if
   we possessed no other evidence of the fact, it might be considered
   doubtful, whether the testimony was true or false; but if by
   astronomical calculation, it should be found, that there must have been
   an eclipse of the sun at the time, and visible at that, place, the
   veracity of the witness, in this case, would be confirmed, beyond all
   possibility of doubt. Or, should we find it recorded by an anonymous
   author, that an earthquake, at a certain time, had overthrown a certain
   city; without further evidence, we should yield but a feeble assent to
   the statement; but if, on personal observation, or by the report of
   respectable travellers, it was ascertained, that the ruins of an
   ancient city existed in that place, we should consider the truth of the
   history as sufficiently established.

   The evidences of the Christian religion may be sufficient, and yet not
   so strong as inevitably to produce conviction. Our conduct in the
   pursuit and reception of truth, may be intended by our Creator, to be
   an important part of the probation to which we are subjected; and,
   therefore, the evidence of revelation is not so great as to be
   irresistible; but is of such a kind, that the sincere and diligent
   inquirer will be in no danger of fatal mistake; while men of pride and
   prejudice, who prefer darkness to light, will be almost sure to err.
   [7]

   It is natural for all men to speak the truth; falsehood requires an
   effort. Wicked men lie, only when they have some sinister end in view.
   Combinations to deceive, are never formed, but with a view to
   accomplish some object desirable to those concerned. No set of men will
   be at the trouble of forging and propagating a falsehood, which
   promises them no profit or gratification. Much less will they engage in
   such an enterpriser with the view of bringing evil on themselves; or,
   when they foresee, that it can be productive of nothing,. but pain and
   reproach.

   Between truth and falsehood there is so great a difference, that it is
   extremely difficult for the latter, so. effectually to assume the garb,
   and exhibit the aspect of the former, as, upon a strict scrutiny, not
   to be detected. No imposture can stand the test of rigid inquiry; and
   when the inquisition is made, the truth seldom, remains doubtful: the
   fraud is pretty sure to become manifest. The style and manner of truth
   are entirely different from those of falsehood. The one pursues a
   direct course, is candid, unaffected, and honest; the other, evasive,
   cunning, tortuous, and inconsistent; and is often betrayed, by the
   efforts made to avoid detection.

   When both sides of a question are pressed with difficulties, reason
   teaches us to choose that which is attended with the fewest. Objectors
   to Christianity often forget to notice the difficulties of their own
   hypothesis. Every question has two sides--if we, reject the
   affirmative, we, of necessity, receive the negative with the
   consequences with which it may be burdened. If we reject the evidence
   of Christianity, and deny that miracles ever existed, we are bound to
   account for the existence of the Christian church, and for the conduct
   of the first preachers and primitive believers, on other principles.
   And whoever seriously undertakes this, will impose on himself a
   difficult task. Gibbon, has put forth his strength, on this subject,
   with very small success. His account of the origin of Christianity is
   very unsatisfactory, and is totally defective in historical evidence.
   [8]

   If the evidences, on both sides of an important question, appear to be
   pretty equally balanced, it is the dictate of wisdom to lean to the
   safe side. In this question, undoubtedly, the safe side is that of
   religion; fir, if we should be mistaken here, we shall suffer no loss,
   and obtain sonic good by our error; but a mistake on the other side,
   must prove fatal.

   When a proposition has been established by proper and sufficient
   evidence, our faith ought not to be shaken by every objection, which we
   may not be able to solve. To admit this, would be to plunge into
   skepticism, on all subjects; for, what truth is there to which some
   objection may not be raised that no man can fully answer? Even the
   clearest truths in science are not exempt from objections of this sort.
   It must be so, as long as our minds are so limited, and the extent of
   human knowledge so narrow. That man judges incorrectly, who supposes,
   that when he has found out some objection to Christianity which cannot
   be satisfactorily answered, he has gained a victory. There are, indeed,
   objections, which relate to the essence of a proposition, which, if
   sustained, do overthrow the evidence; but there are other numerous
   objections which leave the substantial evidence undisturbed. Concerning
   them, I speak, when I say, that objections, though not capable of an
   answer, should not be permitted to unsettle our faith.

   Let us now proceed to the examination of the testimony for the miracles
   recorded in the Gospel. In this. discussion we shall take. it for
   granted, that such a person as Jesus Christ lived in. Judea, about the
   time mentioned by the evangelists;--that he inculcated a pure and
   sublime morality; lived a virtuous and unblamable life; and was put to
   death by Pontius Pilate, at the, instigation of the Jewish rulers.
   Also,. that his, apostles went forth into various countries preaching
   to the people, and declaring that this crucified Jesus was, a person
   sent from God,. for the salvation of the world; and that many were
   induced to connect themselves with the Christian church. These facts
   not being of a miraculous nature, and it being necessary to
   suppose-some such events, deists have commonly been disposed, to admit
   them. But Volney, in his Ruins, and some others, have imagined, that
   such a person as Jesus Christ never existed;--that this is the name of
   one of the celestial luminaries;--and that the Gospel history is an
   allegory. Such visionary theories do not deserve a serious answer; they
   are subversive of all historical truth, and have not a shadow of
   evidence. They may be well left to sink by the weight of their own,
   extravagance. Mons. Volney, however, has received a learned answer from
   a gentleman, [9] who has met him, on his own, ground; and being as much
   attached to astronomical allegories as the Frenchman, has vanquished
   him with his own weapons.

   In the examination of written testimony, the first thing requisite, is
   to prove the authenticity of the documents, in which it is recorded.
   The evidence, on which we depend, for the truth of the miracles
   performed by Jesus Christ, and by his apostles, is contained in the New
   Testament. Here we have four distinct narratives of the life, miracles,
   death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus of Nazareth; and also a
   history of the acts and sufferings of the apostles in preaching the
   Gospel, and laying the foundation of the first Christian churches,
   after the resurrection and ascension of their Master. We have, also, in
   this collection of writings, a number of epistles, addressed to. the
   church in general, to particular churches, and to individuals. These,
   with a book of prophecy, corn-. pose the volume, called the New
   Testament.

   These books are certainly not of recent origin; for there are extant,
   copies of the New Testament, in the. original Greek, which are, at the
   least, twelve hundred, years old. And before the time when these
   manuscripts were penned, we have, in other books, numerous testimonies
   to the existence of die Christian. Scriptures. They are not only
   mentioned, but quoted, expounded, and harmonized so that if every copy
   of. the New Testament had been lost, a large portion of it might be
   recovered, by means of the numerous quotations in the early Christian
   writers. Besides, there, are extant, versions of the New Testament,
   into several languages, made at a very early period. By these means, we
   are able to trace these writings up to the time, in which the apostles
   lived.

   There is also ample proof, not only from Christian, but heathen
   authors, that a society, calling themselves Christians, existed as
   early as the reign. of Nero, who was contemporary with the apostles. It
   is evident, from the necessity of the case, that some such accounts as
   those contained in the Gospels, must have been received as true, from
   the first existence of the Christian church. Unless it had been
   preached and believed that Christ was a divine Teacher, and performed
   extraordinary works in attestation of his mission, how is it possible
   that such a society could have been formed? To suppose such a thing,
   would be to conceive of a, superstructure, without a foundation. The
   resurrection of Christ from the dead, must have been an article of the
   faith of Christians, from their very origin; for it is the corner stone
   of the whole edifice. Take the belief of this away, and the Christian
   system has no existence. There are also some external institutions
   peculiar to Christianity, which we must suppose to be coeval with the
   formation of the society, for they are the badges of the Christian
   profession, and constitute a part of their worship. I refer to baptism,
   and the eucharist. To suppose, that, in some way, Christianity first
   existed, and afterwards received these articles of faith, and these
   institutions of worship, is too improbable to be admitted by any
   impartial man. It would be to suppose that a religious society existed
   without any. principles; or that they rejected their original
   principles, and adopted new ones; and that they who imposed these upon
   them, had the address to persuade them, that they had always belonged
   to their system;--than which is not easy to conceive any thing more
   improbable. Let us, for a moment, attempt to imagine, that previously
   to the publication of the Gospels, the Christian Church had among them
   no report of the miracles, and no account of the institutions, recorded
   in these books. When they opened them, they would read, that their
   society was founded on the belief of the resurrection of Jesus; and
   that baptism and the eucharist were instituted by him before he left
   the world, and had existed among them ever since. Nothing can be more
   evident, therefore, than that the substance of what is contained in the
   Gospels, was believed and practised by Christians, from the
   commencement of the society.

   As these books have come down to us under the names of certain apostles
   and disciples of Jesus Christ, so they were ascribed to the same
   persons, from the earliest mention of them. It is, by the ancient
   Fathers, spoken of as a fact, universally believed among Christians,
   and contradicted by nobody. And we must not suppose, that in the first
   ages of Christianity, there was little care or discrimination
   exercised, in ascertaining the true authors and genuine character of
   the books in circulation. The very reverse is the fact, The most
   diligent inquiries were instituted into matters of this kind. Other
   books were published in the name of the apostles, professing to give an
   account of. Jesus Christ, which were not genuine. The distinction
   between the books of the New Testament, and all others, of every class,
   was as clearly marked, in the earliest ages, as it has ever been since.
   The writings of the apostles were held in great veneration; were
   received by the churches, all over the world, as the rule of their
   faith, and directory of their lives; and publicly read at their
   meetings for the instruction of the people., When any controversy
   arose, they were appealed to as an authoritative standard. As soon as
   published, they were so widely scattered, and so carefully guarded,
   that no persons had it in their power to make any alteration in them.

   The style, or dialect, in which these books are written, furnishes an
   evidence of their authenticity, of peculiar kind. It does not, indeed,
   ascertain the persons of the writers, but proves, that they must have
   been exactly in the circumstances of those to whom these books have
   been uniformly ascribed. The words are Greek but the idiom is Hebrew,
   or rather Syro-Chaldaic, the vernacular tongue of Judea, in the time of
   Christ and his apostles. This is a peculiarity which none could
   counterfeit, and which demonstrates, that the New Testament was not
   composed by men of a different country and age, from those in which the
   apostles lived.

   In the New Testament, there are numerous references to rivers,
   mountains, seas, cities, and countries, which none but a person well
   acquainted with the geography of Judea and. the neighboring countries,
   could have made, without falling into innumerable errors. There is,
   moreover, incidental mention, of persons and facts, known from other
   authorities to have existed, and frequent allusions to manners and
   customs, peculiar to the Jews.

   From all these considerations, it ought to be admitted without dispute,
   that these are indeed the writings of the apostles, and of those
   particular persons to whom they are ascribed. It would not, however,
   destroy their credibility, even if other persons had written them,.
   since they were certainly composed iai that age, and were received by
   the whole body of Christians. But what imaginable reason is there for
   doubting of the genuineness of these books? What persons were so likely
   to write books to guide the faith of the church, as the apostles? If
   they did not write them, who would? And why would they give the credit
   of them to others? But their universal reception, without opposition or
   contradiction, should silence every cavil. The persons who lived at
   this time, knew the apostles, and were deeply interested in the
   subject, and these are the proper judges of this question. And they
   have decided it, unanimously, as it relates to the historical books of
   the New Testament. From them the testimony has come down, through all
   succeeding ages, without a chasm. Even heathen writers and heretics are
   witnesses, that the Gospels were written by the persons whose names
   they bear. [10]

   In other cases, we usually possess no other evidence of the genuineness
   of the most valued writings of antiquity, except the opinion of
   contemporaries, handed down by uncontradicted tradition. How soon would
   Homer be deprived of his glory, if such evidence was insisted on as is
   required for the genuineness of the New Testament? Certainly, as it
   respects evidence of genuineness, no books of antiquity stand upon a
   level with the books of the New Testament. The works of the Greek and
   Latin historians and poets, have no such evidence of being the writings
   of the persons whose names they bear, as the writings of Matthew, Mark,
   Luke, and John. For we have the testimony, not merely of individuals,
   but of numerous societies, widely scattered over the world. We have
   internal evidence, of a kind, which cannot be counterfeited. We have,
   in short, every species of evidence, of which the case admits. It may,
   therefore, be considered, as an established fact, that the books of the
   New Testament are the genuine productions of the apostles; and
   consequently, contain their testimony to the miracles of Jesus Christ,
   and also to those miracles, which, in his name, they performed after
   his ascension.

   It is also certain, that the books of the New Testament have not
   undergone any material change, since they were written; for there is a
   general agreement in all the copies, in all the versions, and in all
   the quotations. There are, it is true, small discrepancies, which have
   occurred, through the ignorance or carelessness of transcribers; but,
   not more than might naturally be expected. There is no ancient book
   which has come down to us so entire as the Scriptures, and which is
   accompanied by so many means of correcting an erroneous reading, where
   it has occurred. This representation may appear surprising to those,
   who have heard of the vast multitude of various readings, which learned
   critics have collected from a collation of the manuscripts; but it
   ought to be understood by all who have ever heard of these
   discrepancies, that not one in a thousand of them, is of the least
   consequence;--that a great majority of them are merely differences in
   orthography, in the collocation of words, or in the use of words
   perfectly synonymous, by which the sense is not in the least affected.
   A cursory reader would find as little difference in the various
   manuscripts of the New Testament, as in the different printed editions
   of the English version.

   Having established the authenticity of the record which contains the
   testimony, we shall next proceed to consider its credibility.

   The serious and candid attention of the reader, is requested to the
   following remarks:

   I. Many of the facts related in the Gospels, are undoubtedly of a
   miraculous nature. It is declared that Jesus Christ, in several
   instances, raised the dead;--in one of which, the person had been dead
   four days, so that the body began to be offensive to the smell. In
   every case, this miracle was wrought instantly, and without any other
   means, than speaking a word. It is declared, that he healed multitudes
   of the most inveterate and incurable diseases;--that he gave sight to
   the blind, hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb, and active limbs to
   the withered and the maimed: that he delivered those who were furious
   and unmanageable, by reason of the possession of demons; that, on
   different occasions, he fed thousands of people with a few loaves and
   fishes until they were satisfied; and that the fragments which were
   gathered up, were much greater in quantity than the original materials;
   that he walked upon the sea, and with a word allayed the raging storm,
   and produced a great calm. And, finally, it is repeatedly and solemnly
   declared, by all the witnesses, that Jesus Christ, after being
   crucified, and after having continued in the sepulchre three days, rose
   from the dead, and after showing himself, frequently, to his disciples,
   ascended to heaven, in their presence.

   That all these were real miracles, none can for a moment doubt. It is
   true, we do not know all the powers of nature; but we do know, as
   certainly as we know any thing, that such works as these could not be
   performed, but by the immediate power of God. The same remark may be
   extended to the miracles wrought by the apostles, in the name of the
   Lord Jesus; and especially, to that stupendous miracle on the day of
   Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost descended on the apostles, in visible
   form, and conferred on them the gift of tongues, and other
   extraordinary endowments. All must admit, that if these events ever
   occurred, then there have existed undoubted miracles.

   II. The miracles of Jesus were performed, for the most part, in an open
   and public manner, in the presence of multitudes of witnesses, under
   the inspection of learned and malignant enemies; in a great variety of
   circumstances, and for several years in succession. There was here no
   room for trick, sleight of hand, illusion of the senses, or any thing
   else, which could impose on the spectators. This circumstance is
   important, because it proves to a certainty, that the apostles
   themselves could not be deluded and deceived, in the testimony which
   they have given. To suppose that they could think that they saw such
   miracles every day, for years, and yet be deceived, would be nearly as
   extravagant a supposition, as that we were deceived in all that we ever
   experienced.

   III. The character of the miracles recorded in the Gospels, ought to be
   carefully observed. They were all worthy of the majesty, justice, and
   benevolence of the Son of God. They are characterized by dignity,
   propriety, and kindness. Most of them, indeed, were acts of tender
   compassion to the afflicted. Although so many miracles were performed,
   in so great a variety of circumstances, yet there is nothing ludicrous,
   puerile, or vindictive, in any of them. Christ never exerted his power
   to gratify the curiosity of any, or to supply his own daily wants. Ile
   made no ostentatious display of his wonderful power, and never used it
   to acquire wealth and influence. While he fed hungry multitudes by a
   miracle, he submitted to hunger and want himself; while he could
   command all nature, he remained in poverty;--not having so much as a
   home of any kind, to which he could retire to find repose. Although he
   was rejected and ill-treated by the Jews, yet he never refused to
   relieve any who sincerely sought his aid. His life, in consequence of
   the multitudes who flocked to him, was fatiguing, and on many accounts
   unpleasant, but he never grew weary in doing good.

   Let any man compare the narrative of the miracles of Christ, contained
   in the genuine Gospels, with those fictitious accounts, which may be
   found in the apochryphal and spurious Gospels, still extant, and he
   will be struck with the remarkable contrast between them. The same
   result will be the consequence of a comparison of the miracles of
   Christ, with those, ascribed by the followers of Mohammed, to the
   impostor; or those contained in the legends of the church of Rome. I
   know not how any impartial man can read attentively the account of the
   miracles recorded in the Gospels, and not be convinced, from the very
   nature and circumstances of the facts reported, that they were real.

   IV. There are no signs of fraud or imposture to be discovered in the
   record itself. There is, on the contrary, every indication of truth,
   honesty, and good intention, in the writers. Although they differ from
   each other in style and manner, so much, that it is evident, that the
   same person did not compose the four Gospels; yet there is a character
   of style which belongs to the whole of them, and which is without a
   parallel among any writers but the penmen of the Sacred Scriptures. It
   is an apparent exemption from the passions and frailties of human
   nature. The most stupendous miracles, are related without one
   exclamation of wonder from the historian: and without the least
   appearance of a desire to excite the wonder of the reader.

   The character of Christ is drawn in no other way, than by simply
   telling what he did and said. There is no portraying of character in
   the way of general description, or by using strong epithets to set him
   forth. There is, perhaps, no such thing, in the Gospels, as an
   expression of admiration of any discourse or action, by the
   evangelists. If they relate such things, they are the words of others,
   which they faithfully set down. When they describe the sufferings of
   Christ, they never fall, as men usually do, into pathetic declamation.
   They are never carried away from their simple course by the power of
   sympathy. The facts are related, as though the writer felt nothing, but
   the strong purpose of declaring the truth, without giving any color
   whatever to the facts. Neither do they indulge themselves in those
   vehement expressions of indignation against the enemies of Christ,
   which we should naturally have expected. They never give utterance to a
   harsh expression against any one. They relate the treachery of Judas
   with the same unaffected simplicity, as if they had no feelings
   relative to his base conduct.

   But there is something which exhibits the true character of the
   writers, in a light still stronger. It is the manner in which they
   speak of themselves. Few men can write much concerning themselves,
   without betraying the strength of self-love. Weak men, when they get on
   this topic, are commonly disgusting: and even when persons seem willing
   to let the truth be known, there is usually an effort discoverable, to
   seek compensation, in something, for every sacrifice which they make of
   reputation. But we may challenge any one to designate any instance, in
   which the least indication of this moral weakness has been given by the
   evangelists? They speak of themselves, and their companions, with the
   same candor, which characterizes their narrative in regard to others.
   They describe, in the most artless manner, the lowness of their origin,
   the meanness of their occupation, the grossness of their ignorance, the
   inveteracy of their prejudices, their childish contentions for
   superiority, their cowardice in the hour of danger, and the fatal
   apostacy of one, and temporary delinquency of another of their number.
   If any person supposes that it is an easy thing to write as the
   evangelists have done, he must have attended very little to the
   subject. The fact is, it cannot be imitated now, when the model is
   fully before us. That these unlearned men should be able to write books
   at all, with propriety, is a wonderful thing. Few fishermen, or
   mechanics, confined all their lives to laborious occupations, and
   untutored in the art of composition, could produce, without committing
   great faults, a narrative of their own lives. But that men of such an
   education should possess such self-command and self-denial, as is
   manifest in these compositions, cannot be easily accounted for, on
   common principles.

   That, however, which deserves our special attention, is the absence of
   all appearance of ill design. I should like to ask a candid infidel, to
   point out, in the Gospel, some fact, or speech, which in the remotest
   degree, tends to prove, that the writers had a bad end in view. I need
   not say, that he could find nothing of the kind. Then, upon his
   hypothesis, we have this extraordinary fact; that four books, written
   by impostors, who have imposed on the world a series of falsehoods, do,
   in no part of them, betray the least appearance of ill design, or
   sinister purpose. Certainly, no other books, written by deceivers,
   possess the same characteristics.

   We have some instances of men of learning and piety, manifesting
   uncommon candor, in the accounts which they have left of their own
   errors, prejudices, and faults; but in all of them you perceive the
   semblance, if not the reality of human frailty. These works, however,
   are very valuable. Some eminent infidels, also, have come forward
   before the world, with CONFESSIONS, and narratives of their lives, and
   even of their secret crimes.

   None has made himself more conspicuous in this way, than J. J. Rosseau,
   who professes to exhibit to the world, a full confession of his faults,
   during a period of many years. And to do him justice, he has exposed to
   view moral turpitude enough, to make, if it were possible, a demon
   blush. But this infatuated man gloried in his shame: and declared it to
   be his purpose, when called before the tribunal of Heaven, to appear
   with his book in his hand, and present it to his Judge, as his
   confession and apology. Through the transparent covering of
   affectation, we may observe the most disgusting pride and arrogance.
   While common sense and decency are outraged, by a needless confession
   of deeds which ought not to be once named, he is so far from exhibiting
   any thing of the character of a true penitent, that he rather appears
   as the shameless apologist of vice. By his unreserved disclosures, he
   aspired to a new sort of reputation and glory. Perhaps, there is not,
   in any language, a composition mom strongly marked with pride and
   presumption. His confessions were manifestly made, in a confidence of
   the corruption of mankind, from whom he expected much applause for his
   candor, and small censure for his vices; but as he has appealed, also,
   to another tribunal, we may be permitted to doubt, whether he will
   there find as much applause, and as slight condemnation, as he affected
   to expect. Between such impious confessions as these, and the simple,
   humble, and sober statements of the evangelists, there can be no
   comparison.

   There is only, one other thing, in the style of the apostles, which I
   wish to bring into view. In all the detailed narratives which they have
   given of Jesus Christ, no allusion is ever made to his personal
   appearance. We are as much unacquainted with his stature, his aspect,
   his complexion, and his gait and manner, as if the Gospels had never
   been written. There is profound wisdom in this silence: yet I doubt
   whether any writers, following merely the impulse of their own
   feelings, would have avoided every allusion to tilts subject.

   V. There is no just ground of objection to the testimony, on account of
   the paucity of the witnesses. In regard to most facts handed down to us
   by authentic history, it is seldom, that we have more than two or three
   historians, testifying the same things; and in many cases, we receive
   the testimony of one as sufficient, if all the circumstances of the
   fact corroborate his narrative. But here, we have four distinct and
   independent witnesses, who were perfectly acquainted with the facts
   which they relate. Two of these, Matthew and John, were of the number
   of the twelve, who accompanied Jesus, wherever he went, and saw, from
   day to day, the works which he performed. Mark and Luke might also have
   been eye-witnesses. Many think that they were of the number of the
   seventy disciples, sent out by Christ to preach; but if they were not,
   they might have been his followers, and have been often present, in
   Jerusalem and other places, where he exhibited his miracles. It is not
   necessary, however, to resort to either of these suppositions. They
   were contemporaries, early disciples, constant companions of the
   apostles, and travelled much among the churches. Mark was, at first,
   the companion of Paul and Barnabas, and afterwards, attached himself to
   Peter, from whose preaching, according to the universal tradition of
   the early Fathers, he composed his Gospel. Luke was chosen by the
   churches in Asia to accompany Paul in his labors, and was almost
   constantly with him, until his first imprisonment at Rome; at which
   time, his history of the life and labors of that apostle terminates

   Besides these four evangelists, who have professedly written an account
   of the miracles of Jesus Christ, we have the incidental testimony of
   those apostles, who wrote the epistles, especially of Paul. It is true,
   Paul was not one of the twelve apostles who accompanied Christ on
   earth; but lie became an apostle, under such circumstances, as rendered
   his testimony as strong, as that of any other witness. He informs us,
   that he was met by Jesus near to Damascus, when he was "breathing out
   threatning and slaughter" against the disciples of Christ: who appeared
   to him in the midst of a resplendent light, and spoke to him. From that
   moment he became his devoted follower, and the most laborious and
   successful preacher of the Gospel. He abandoned the most flattering
   worldly prospects, which any young man in the Jewish nation could have.
   He possessed genius, learning, an unblemished character for religion
   and morality; was in high favor with the chief men of his nation, and
   seems to have been more zealous than any other individual, to extirpate
   Christianity. How can it be accounted for, that he should suddenly
   become a Christian, unless he did indeed see the risen Jesus? Instead
   of bright worldly prospects, which he had before, he was now subjected
   to persecution and contempt, wherever he went. The catalogue of only a
   part of his sufferings, which he gives in one of his epistles, is
   enough to appal the stoutest heart; yet, he never repented of his
   becoming a Christian, but continued to devote all his energies to the
   promotion of the Gospel, as long as he lived. This change, in a person
   of Paul's character and prospects, will never be accounted for upon
   principles of imposture, or enthusiasm. [11] Here, then, we can produce
   what. deists often demand, the testimony of an enemy. Not of one who
   was unconvinced by the evidence of Christianity, which would be an
   inconsistent testimony, and liable to great objections; but of one
   whose mind had been long inflamed with zeal against Christianity; and
   yet, by the force of evidence, was converted to be a zealous disciple,
   and retained, all his life, a deep and unwavering conviction of the
   truth of the Gospel. [12] This man, although he has not written a
   Gospel, has given repeated testimonies to the truth of the leading
   facts, which are now in question. Especially, he is one of the best
   witnesses on the subject of the resurrection of Christ; for he not only
   saw and conversed with Jesus after his ascension, but has informed us
   of some circumstances, of great importance, not mentioned by any of the
   evangelists. He asserts that Christ was seen by five hundred persons at
   one time, most of whom were still living when he wrote. If there had
   been any falsehood in this declaration, how soon must it have been
   detected? His letters, no doubt, were immediately transcribed, and
   conveyed to every part of the church; and how easy would it have been
   to prove the falsehood of such a declaration, if it had not been a
   fact? But almost every page of Paul's writings recognises as true, the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ. his constantly assumed as a truth most
   assuredly believed by all Christians. It is the great motive of
   exertion and source of consolation, in all his epistles. And when he
   would convince certain heretics of the absurdity of denying the
   resurrection of the body, he reduces them to this conclusion, that "if
   the dead rise not, then is Christ not risen," which would be, at once,
   to subvert the Christian religion. His appeal to the common assured
   belief of Christians, is remarkably strong, and pertinent to our
   purpose; "If," says he, "Christ be not risen, then is our preaching
   vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false
   witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up
   Christ, whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not." Would
   any man in his senses, have written thus, if the resurrection of Christ
   had not been a fundamental article of faith among Christians; or if he
   had not been fully persuaded of its truth? Had Paul been an impostor,
   would he have dared to appeal to five hundred persons, most of whom
   were living, for the truth of what he knew to be false? How easy, and
   how certain, must have been the detection of an imposture thus
   conducted?

   The same is evident from the epistles of the other apostles, and from
   the Apocalypse.

   Now, when we can clearly ascertain what any persons believed in
   relation to a we have, virtually their testimony to that fact; because,
   when they come forward and give testimony, explicitly, they do no more
   than express the conviction of their own minds. Certainly, then, if we
   can by any means, ascertain what the primitive Christians believed in
   regard to the resurrection of Christ, and other miraculous facts, we
   are in possession of all the testimony which they could give. [13] This
   is an important point as it relates to the number of witnesses. Now,
   that all Christians, from the beginning, did believe in the facts
   recorded in the Gospels and Epistles of the apostles, we have the
   strongest possible evidence. It is proved incontestably, from the fact
   of their becoming Christians; for how could they be Christians without
   faith in Christianity? unless any one will be so extravagant as to
   believe, that not only the apostles, but all their converts, were
   wilful deceivers. It is proved also from the manner in which Christians
   are addressed by the apostles, in all the epistle. Suppose, for a
   moment, that the Corinthian church had no belief in the resurrection of
   Christ, when they received the above-mentioned epistle from Paul; would
   they not have considered him perfectly insane? But the universal
   reception of the Gospels and Epistles, by all Christian churches,
   throughout the world, is the best possible evidence that they believed
   what they contained. These books were adopted as the creed and guide of
   all Christians. It is manifest, therefore, that we are in possession of
   the testimony of the whole primitive church, to the truth of the
   miracles recorded in the Gospels. Suppose a document had come down to
   us, containing a profession of the belief of every person who embraced
   the Christian religion, and a solemn attestation to the facts on which
   Christianity is founded, would any man object, that the witnesses were
   too few? The fact is, that we have substantially, this whole body of
   testimony. I do not perceive, that its force would have been sensibly
   greater had it been transmitted to us with all the formalities just
   mentioned. There is, therefore, no defect in the number of witnesses.
   If every one of the twelve apostles had written a Gospel, and a hundred
   other persons had done the same, the evidence would not be essentially
   improved. We should have no more, after all, than the testimony of the
   whole primitive church, which, as has been proved, we possess already.

   VI. The credibility of the testimony is not impaired by any want of
   agreement among the witnesses. In their attestation to the leading
   facts, and to the doctrines and character of Christ, they are perfectly
   harmonious. The selection of facts by the several evangelists is
   different, and the same fact is sometimes related more circumstantially
   by one, than another; yet there is no inconsistency between them. In
   their general character, and prominent features, there is a beautiful
   harmony in the Gospels. There is no difference which can affect, in the
   judgment of the impartial, the credibility of the testimony, which they
   contain. If all the evangelists had recorded precisely the same facts,
   and all the circumstances, in the same order, the Gospels would have
   the appearance of having been written in concert, which would weaken
   their testimony. But it is almost demonstrable, from internal evidence,
   that the evangelists, with the exception of John, never had seen each
   other's productions, before they wrote. Their agreement, therefore,
   ought to have the effect of witnesses examined apart from each other;
   and their discrepancies serve to prove, that there could be no
   concerted scheme to deceive; for in that case every appearance of this
   kind would have been carefully removed.

   I am aware, however, that on the ground of supposed contradictions, or
   irreconcilable discrepancies, the most formidable attacks have been
   made on Christianity. It is entirely incompatible with the narrow
   limits of this essay, to enter into a consideration of the various
   methods which have been adapted for harmonizing the Gospels, and
   removing the difficulties which arise from their variations. I can only
   make a few general observations, with the view of leading the reader to
   the proper principles of solution.

   It ought to be kept in mind, that the Gospels were written almost two
   thousand years ago, in a language not now spoken; in a remote country,
   whose manners and customs were very different from ours. In all such
   cases, there will be obscurities and difficulties, arising entirely
   from the imperfection of our knowledge.

   The Gospels do not purport to be regular histories of events, arranged
   in exact chronological order, but a selection of important facts, out
   of a much greater number left unnoticed. The time when, or the place
   where, these facts occurred, is of no consequence to the end
   contemplated by the evangelists. In their narratives, therefore, they
   have sometimes pursued the order of time; and in other cases, the
   arrangement has been suggested by the subject previously treated, or by
   some other circumstance.

   In recording a miracle, the number of persons benefitted, is not of
   much consequence; the miracle is the same, whether sight be restored to
   one person, or two; or whether demons be expelled from one, or many. If
   one historian, intent on recording the extraordinary facts, selects the
   case of one person, which might, in. some accounts, be more remarkable;
   and another mentions two, there is no contradiction. If they had
   professed to give an accurate account of the number healed, there would
   be ground for this objection; but this was no part of the design of the
   evangelists.

   If a writer, with a view of exhibiting the skill of an oculist, should
   mention a remarkable instance of sight being restored to a person who
   bad been long blind, it could not be fairly inferred from the
   narrative, that no other person received the same benefit, at that
   time; and, if, another person should give a distinct account of all the
   cases, there would be no contradiction between these witnesses. All the
   difference is, that one selects a prominent fact out of many; the other
   descends to all the particular.

   There is no source of difficulty more usual, than the confounding of
   things which are distinct. The narratives of events truly distinct, may
   have so striking a similarity, that the cursory reader will be apt to
   confound them. It has been remarked by a learned man, [14] that if the
   two miracles of feeding the multitude, bad been mentioned by two
   different evangelists, each giving an account of one case, it would
   have been supposed by many that they were accounts of the same
   occurrence, and that the evangelists did not agree in their testimony:
   but in this case, both these miracles are distinctly related by the
   same evangelist, and distinctly referred to by Christ, in his
   conversation with his disciples. This confounding of distinct things is
   never more commonly done, than when a fact was attended with a great
   number of circumstances and occurrences, rapidly succeeding each other,
   and the historian mentions only a few out of many. This remark is fully
   verified with respect to Christ's resurrection. The narrative of all
   the evangelists is very concise. Few particulars are mentioned; and yet
   from the nature of the case, there must have been an extraordinary
   degree of agitation among the disciples; a great running from one part
   of Jerusalem to another, to tell the news; and a frequent paging to and
   from the sepulchre. It is not wonderful, therefore, that, as each
   evangelist mentions only a few of the accompanying occurrences; there
   should seem, at first view, to be some discrepancy in their accounts.

   Companies of women are mentioned by each, and it is hastily taken for
   granted, that they were all the same; and the objector proceeds on the
   supposition, that these women all arrived at the sepulchre, at the same
   time, and that they continued together. He forgets to take into view,
   that the persons who might agree to meet at the sepulchre, probably
   lived at very different distances from the place, and allows nothing
   for the agitation and distraction produced by the reports and visions
   of this interesting morning. But on this, as on several other subjects,
   we are indebted to the enemies of revelation for being the occasion of
   bringing forward able men, who have shed so much light on this part of
   the Gospel history, that even the appearance of discrepancy is entirely
   removed. [15]

   The genealogy of Jesus Christ, as given by Matthew and Luke, has
   furnished to modern infidels much occasion of cavil; but it ought to be
   sufficient to silence these objectors, that the early enemies of
   Christianity made no objections on this ground. If one of these is the
   genealogy of Joseph and the other of Mary, there will be no discrepancy
   between them. Why it was proper to give the descent of Joseph, the
   husband of Mary, it is not now necessary to inquire. But on this whole
   subject, I would remark, that we are very little acquainted with the
   plan on which genealogical tables were constructed. It seems to have
   been a very intricate business, and it is not surprising that we should
   be at a loss to elucidate every difficulty.

   Again, it is highly probable, that these lists were. taken from some
   genealogical tables of the tribe and family of the persons to whom they
   refer. Every family must have had access to such tables; on account of
   their inheritance. Public tables of acknowledged authority, would be
   far better for the purpose which the evangelists had in view, than new
   ones, even though these should have been more full and accurate. These
   genealogies had no other object than to prove that Jesus of Nazareth
   was a lineal descendant of David and Abraham; which purpose. is
   completely answered by them; and there are no difficulties which may
   not be accounted for by our ignorance of the subject.

   Finally, it may be admitted, that some slight inaccuracies have crept
   into the copies of the New Testament, through the carelessness of
   transcribers. It is impossible for men to write the whole of a book,
   without making some mistakes; and if there be some small discrepancies,
   in the Gospels, with respect to names and numbers, they ought to be
   attributed to this cause.

   VII. The witnesses of the miracles of Christ could have had no
   conceivable motive for propagating an imposture. That they were not
   themselves deceived is manifest from the nature of the facts, and from
   the full opportunity which they had of examining them. It is evident,
   therefore, that if the miracles recorded by them never existed, they
   were wilful impostors. They must have wickedly combined, to impose upon
   the world. But what motives could have influenced them to pursue such a
   course, we cannot imagine; or how men of low condition and small
   education, should have ever conceived it possible to deceive the world,
   in such a case, is equally inconceivable. These men had worldly
   interests, which it was natural for them to regard; but every thing of
   this kind, was fully relinquished. They engaged in an enterprise not
   only dangerous, but attended with certain and immediate ruin to all
   their worldly interests. They exposed themselves to the indignation of
   all authority, and to the outrageous fury of the multitude. They must
   have foreseen, that they would bring down upon themselves the vengeance
   of the civil and ecclesiastical powers, and that every species of
   suffering awaited them. Their leader was crucified, and what could they
   expect from declaring that he was alive, and had performed wonderful
   miracles? If they could have entertained any hopes of exemption from
   evils so apparent, experience must soon have convinced them, that they
   had engaged not only in a wicked, but most unprofitable undertaking. It
   was not long after they began their testimony, before they were obliged
   to endure unrelenting persecution from Jews and Gentiles. Could they
   have been influenced by a regard to fame? What renown could they expect
   from proclaiming a crucified man to be their master, and the object of
   all their hope and confidence? If this was their object, why did they
   give. all the glory to another who was. dead? But the fact is, that
   instead of fame, they met with infamy. No name was ever more derided
   and hated than that of Christian. They were vilified as the most
   contemptible miscreants that ever lived; as the refuse and offscouring
   of all things; as the pests and disturbers of society, and the enemies
   of the gods. They were pursued as outlaws, and punished for no other
   reason, but because they acknowledged themselves to be Christians.
   Would men persevere in propagating an imposture for such fame as this?
   It cannot be supposed that they expected their compensation in another
   world; for, the supposition is, that they were wilful impostors, who
   were, every day, asserting, in the most solemn manner, that the
   murderer or highway robber is influenced in the commission of his
   atrocious crimes, by the hope of a future reward.

   The only alternative is, to suppose, that they were fanatics; as it is
   known, that men under the government of enthusiasm, contemn all the
   common considerations, which usually influence human conduct; and often
   act in a way totally unaccountable. This representation of enthusiasm
   is just, but it will not answer the purpose for which it is adduced.
   Enthusiasts are always. strongly persuaded of the truth of the religion
   which they wish to propagate; but these men, upon the hypothesis under
   consideration, knew that all which they said was false. Enthusiasm, and
   imposture are irreconcilable. It is true, that, what begins in
   enthusiasm, may end in imposture; but in. this case, the imposture must
   have been the beginning, as well as the end, of the whole business.
   There was no room for enthusiasm; all was imposture, if the facts
   reported, were not true. But the best evidence, that the evangelists
   were not wild fanatics, is derived front their writings. These are at
   the greatest remove from the ravings or reveries of enthusiasm. They
   are the most simple, grave, and dispassionate narratives, that ever
   were written. These books, certainly, were not the production of crazy
   fanatics. The writers are actuated by no frenzy; they give no
   indication of a heated imagination; they speak, uniformly, the language
   of "truth and soberness."

   VIII. But if we could persuade ourselves, that the apostles might have
   been actuated by some unknown and inconceivable motive, to forge the-
   whole account of Christ's miracles; and were impelled by some
   unaccountable phrensy, to persevere, through all difficulties and
   sufferings, to propagate lies; yet, can we believe, that they could
   have found followers, in the very country, and in the very city, where
   the miracles were stated to have been performed?

   When these accounts of stupendous and numerous miracles were published
   in Jerusalem where the apostles began their testimony, what would the
   people think? Would they not say, "These men bring strange things to
   our ears? They tell us of wonders wrought among us, of which we have
   never before heard. And they would not only have us to believe their
   incredible story, but forsake all. that we have, abandon our friends,
   and relinquish the religion of our fore-fathers, received from God: and
   not only so, but bring upon ourselves and families, the vengeance of
   those that rule over us, and the hatred and reproach of all men." Is it
   possible to believe, that one sane person, would have received their
   report?

   Besides, the priests and rulers who had put Jesus to death, were deeply
   interested to prevent the circulation of such a story. It implicated
   them in a horrid crime. Would they not have exerted themselves to lay
   open the forgery, and would there have been the least difficulty in
   accomplishing the object, if the testimony of these witnesses had been
   false? The places of many of the miracles are recorded, and the names
   of the persons healed, or raised from the dead, mentioned. It was only
   one or two miles to the dwelling of Lazarus; how easy would it have
   been to prove that the story of his resurrection was a falsehood, had
   it not been a fact? Indeed, Jerusalem itself, and the temple, were the
   scenes of many of the miracles ascribed to Christ. As he spent much
   time in that city, it is presumable, that not a person residing there,
   could have been totally ignorant of facts which must have occupied the
   attention and excited the curiosity of every body. An imposture like
   this could never be successful, in such circumstances. The presence of
   an interested, inimical, and powerful body of men, would soon have put
   down every attempt at an imposition so gross and groundless. If the
   apostles had pretended, that at some remote period, or in some remote
   country, a man had performed miracles, they might have persuaded some
   weak and credulous persons; but they appealed to the people to whom
   they preached, as the witnesses of what they related. No more than a
   few weeks had elapsed after the death of Jesus, before this testimony
   was published in Jerusalem: and, notwithstanding all the opposition of
   those in authority, it was received, and multitudes willingly offered
   themselves as the disciples of him, whom they had recently crucified.

   The success of the Gospel, under the circumstances of its first
   publication, is one of the most wonderful' effects recorded in history;
   and it is a fact beyond all dispute. In a little time, thousands of
   persons embraced the Christian religion, in Jerusalem, and in other
   parts of Judea. In heathen countries, its success was still more
   astonishing.

   Churches were planted in all the principal cities of the Roman Empire,
   before half a century had elapsed from the resurrection of Christ. The
   fires of persecution raged; thousands and tens of thousands of
   unoffending Christians were put to death, in a cruel manner; yet this
   cause' seemed to prosper the more, so that it became a proverb, that
   "the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church." And it went on
   increasing and prevailing, until, in less than three centuries, it
   became the religion of the empire.

   Learned infidels have in vain attempted to assign an adequate cause for
   this event, on natural principles. Gibbon, as has been before stated,
   exerted all his ingenuity to account for the progress and establishment
   of Christianity; but although he has freely indulged conjecture, and
   disregarded the testimony of Christians, his efforts have been
   unavailing. The account which he has given, is entirely unsatisfactory.
   Upon the deistical hypothesis, it is a grand revolution, without any
   adequate cause. That a few unlearned and simple men, mostly fishermen
   of Galilee, should have been successful in changing the religion of the
   world, without power or patronage, and employing no other weapons but
   persuasion, must, forever, remain an unaccountable thing, unless we
   admit the reality of miracles, and supernatural aid.

   The argument from the rapid and extensive progress. of the Gospel may
   be estimated, if we consider the following circumstances:

   1. The insufficiency of the instruments to accomplish such a work,
   without supernatural aid. They had neither the learning nor address to
   make such an impression on the minds of men, as was requisite, to bring
   about such a revolution.

   2. The places in which the Gospel was first preached and had greatest
   success, furnish proof, that it could not have been propagated merely
   by human means. These were not obscure corners, remote from the lights
   of science, but the most populous and polished cities, where every
   species of the learning of the age was concentrated, and whither men of
   learning resorted. Damascus, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, Phillippi, and
   Rome, furnished the theatre for the first preachers of the Gospel. It
   is believed, that there was no conspicuous city, in the central part of
   the Roman, empire, in which a Christian church was not planted, before
   the death of the apostles. And it ought to be remembered, that this did
   not occur in a dark age, but in what is acknowledged by all, to be the
   most enlightened age of antiquity: it was the period which immediately
   succeeded the Augustan Age, so much, and so deservedly celebrated, for
   its classical authors. If the Gospel had been an imposture, its
   propagators would never have gone to such places, in the first
   instance; or if they had, they could not have escaped detection.

   3. The obstacles to be overcome were great, and insurmountable by human
   effort. The people were all attached to the respective superstitions,
   in which they had been educated, and which were all adapted to retain
   their hold on corrupt minds. How difficult is it to obtain, even a
   hearing, from people in such circumstances, is manifest from the
   experience of all missionaries, in modern times. Philosophers, priests,
   and rulers, were combined against them. All that learning, eloquence,
   prejudice, interest, and power, could oppose to them, stood in their
   way.

   4. It would have been impracticable for a few unlettered Jews to
   acquire the languages of all the nations, among whom the Gospel spread,
   in so short a time. They must have had the gift of tongues; or this
   conquest could never have been achieved. Besides, it ought to be
   remembered, that Jews were held in great contempt, by all the
   surrounding nations. A few persons of this nation, exhibiting a very
   mean appearance, as must have been the case, would have called forth
   nothing but derision and contempt, in any of the large cities of the
   Empire. It is more unlikely that they should have been able to make
   many converts, than it would be now, for a few poor Jewish mechanics to
   proselyte to Judaism, vast multitudes, in all the principal cities of
   Europe and America. [16]

   5. The terms of discipleship, which the apostles proposed, and the
   doctrines which they preached, were not adapted to allure and flatter
   the people, but must have been very repulsive to the minds of men.

   6. Many Christians were cut off by persecution, but still Christianity
   made progress, and was extended in all directions. Because Christianity
   increased and flourished under bloody persecutions, many persons have
   adopted it as a maxim, that persecution has a tendency to promote any
   cause; than which it is difficult to conceive of any thing more
   contrary to common sense and experience. In most cases, by cutting off
   the leaders of a party, however furious their fanaticism, the cause
   will decline, and soon become extinct. The increase of Christianity,
   under ten bloody persecutions, can only be accounted for, by supposing,
   that God by his grace on the hearts of men, persuaded them to embrace
   the truth, and inspired them with more than heroic fortitude, in
   suffering for the sake of their religion.

   IX. The apostles and many of the primitive Christians, attested the
   truth by martyrdom. They sealed their testimony with their blood. To
   this argument it is sometimes answered, that men may suffer martyrdom
   for a false as well as a true religion; and that, in fact, men have
   been willing to die for opinions, in direct opposition to each other.
   While this is admitted, it does not affect the argument now adduced.
   All, that dying for an opinion can prove, (and of this it is the best
   possible evidence,) is, the sincerity of the witnesses But in the case
   before us, the sincerity of the witnesses proves the facts in question;
   for we have seen, that they could not themselves have been deceived.
   Every martyr had the opportunity of knowing the truth of the facts on
   which Christianity was founded; and by suffering death in attestation
   of them, he has given the most impressive testimony that can he
   conceived. [17]

   The sufferings of the primitive Christians, for their religion, were
   exceedingly great, and are attested by heathen, as well as Christian
   writers. It is a circumstance of great importance, in this argument,
   that they could at once have escaped all their torments, by renouncing
   Christianity. To bring them to this, was the sole object of their
   persecutors; and, uniformly, it was put to their choice, to offer
   sacrifice or incense to the heathen gods, or be tormented. One word
   would have been sufficient to deliver them; one easy action would have
   restored them to worldly comforts and honors: But they steadfastly
   adhered to their profession. Some, indeed, were overcome by the cruelty
   of their persecutors; but was it ever beard that any of them confessed
   that there was any fraud or imposture, among them? So far from it, that
   they, whose courage had failed them in the trying hour, were commonly
   deep penitents on account of their weakness, all the rest of their
   days. Let it be remembered, that no person suffered for Christianity
   through necessity. Every martyr made a voluntary sacrifice of himself,
   to maintain the truth, and to preserve a good conscience.

   There is yet another light in which these sufferings of the primitive
   Christians ought to be viewed. It is the temper with which they endured
   every kind of torment. Here again is a problem for the deist to solve.
   Persons of all ages, of all conditions of life, and of both sexes,
   exhibited under protracted and cruel torments, a fortitude, a patience,
   a meekness, a spirit of charity and forgiveness, a cheerfulness, yea,
   often a triumphant joy, of which there are no examples to be found in
   the history of the world. They rejoiced when they were arrested;
   cheerfully bid adieu to their nearest and dearest relatives; gladly
   embraced the stake; welcomed the wild beasts let loose to devour them;
   smiled on the horrible apparatus by which their sinews were to be
   stretched, and their bones dislocated and broken; uttered no complaint;
   gave no indication of pain when their bodies were enveloped in flames;
   and when condemned to die, begged of their friends to interpose no
   obstacle to their felicity, (for such they esteemed martyrdom,) not
   even by prayers for their deliverance. [18] What more than human
   fortitude watt this? By what spirit were these despised and persecuted
   people sustained? What natural principles, in the human constitution,
   can satisfactorily account for such superiority to pain and death?
   Could attachment to an impostor inspire them with such feelings? No; it
   was the promised presence of the risen Jesus which upheld them, and
   filled them with assurance and joy. It was the Paraclete, promised by
   their Lord, who poured into their hearts a peace and joy so complete,
   that they were scarcely sensible of the wounds inflicted on their
   bodies.

   Proud and obstinate men may, for aught I know, suffer death for what
   they are secretly convinced is not true; but that multitudes, of all
   conditions, should joyfully suffer for what they knew to be an
   imposture, is impossible. Tender women, and venerable old men, were
   among the most conspicuous of the martyrs of Jesus. They loved not
   their lives unto the death, and having given their testimony and sealed
   it with their blood, they are now clothed in white robes, and bear
   palms in their hands, and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Blessed
   martyrs, they have rested from their labors, and their works have
   followed them!

   X. The last particular which I shall mention, to set the testimony of
   the witnesses to the miracles of the Gospel in its true light, is, that
   there is no counter testimony. These witnesses have never been
   confronted and contradicted by others. Whatever force or probability
   their declarations are entitled to, from the circumstances of the case,
   and from the evidences which we possess of their integrity and
   intelligence, suffers no deduction, on account of other persons giving
   a different testimony.

   The Jewish priests and rulers did, indeed, cause to be circulated, a
   story, relative to the dead body of Christ, contrary to the testimony
   of the apostles, which has been handed down to us by the evangelists.
   They hired the soldiers to report., that Christ's disciples had come by
   night, and stolen the body, while they slept--a story too absurd and
   inconsistent to require a moment's refutation. But as the body was gone
   out of their possession; they could not, perhaps, have invented any
   thing more plausible. It proved nothing, however, except that the body
   was removed while the soldiers slept, and for aught they could testify,
   might have risen from the dead, according to the testimony of the
   apostles.

   Deists sometimes demand the testimony of the enemies, as well as the
   friends of Christianity. To which I would reply, that the silence of
   enemies, is all that can reasonably be expected from them. That they
   should come forward, voluntarily, with testimony in favor of a
   religion, which, through prejudice, or worldly policy, they opposed,
   could not reasonably be expected. Now, since they would have
   contradicted these facts, if it had been in their power, their not
   doing so, furnishes the strongest negative evidence, which we can
   possess. And no other evidence than that which is negative, or merely
   incidental, ought to be expected from the enemies of the Gospel;
   unless, like Paul, they were convinced by the evidence exhibited to
   them. But no denial of the reality of the miracles of Christ has
   reached us from any quarter. As far as we have any accounts, there is
   no reason to think, that they were ever denied by his most implacable
   enemies. They said, that he performed his works by the help of
   Beelzebub. The first heathen writers against Christianity, did not dare
   to deny Christ's miracles. Neither Celsus, Porphyry, Hierocles, nor
   Julian, pretend, that these facts were entirely false; for they
   attempted to account for them. The Jewish Rabbies, in the Talmud,
   acknowledge these miracle`, and pretend that they were wrought by
   magic, or by the power of the venerable name of Jehovah, called,
   tertragrammaton, which they ridiculously pretend, Jesus stole out of
   the temple, and by which they say he performed wonderful works.

   From what has been said, I trust it is sufficiently manifest, that we
   have such testimony for the miracles of the New Testament, as will
   render them credible, in the view of all impartial persons. We have
   shown that the miracles recorded are real miracles;--that. they were
   performed in an open and public manner;--that the witnesses could not
   possibly have been deceived themselves;--that enemies had every
   opportunity and motive for disproving the facts if they had not been
   true;--that there is every evidence of sincerity and honesty in the
   evangelists;--that the epistles of the apostles furnish strong
   collateral proof of the same facts;--that all Christians from the
   beginning, must have .believed in these miracles, and they must,
   therefore, be considered competent witnesses;--that none of the.
   witnesses could have any motive to deceive;--that they never could have
   succeeded in imposing such a fraud on the world, if they could have
   attempted it;--that it would have been the easiest thing in the world,
   for the Jewish Rulers to have silenced such reports if they had been
   false;--that the commencement of preaching. at Jerusalem, and the
   success of Christianity there, cannot be accounted for, on any other
   principles, than the truth of the miracles;--that the conduct of the
   apostles in going to the most enlightened countries and cities, and
   their success in those places, can never be reconciled with the idea
   that they were ignorant impostors;--that the astonishing progress of
   the Gospel, in the midst of opposition and persecution, and the
   extraordinary temper of the primitive Christians, under sufferings of
   the most cruel kind, can only be accounted for, on the supposition of a
   full persuasion of the truth of the facts, and that this persuasion is
   proof of their reality;--and, finally, that no contrary evidence
   exists: but that even the early enemies of Christianity have been
   obliged to admit, that such miracles were performed.

   Now, when all these things are fairly and fully considered, is it not
   reasonable to conclude, that it is more probable that miracles should
   have been performed, than that such a body of testimony, so
   corroborated by circumstances, and by effects reaching to our own
   times, should be false?

   If all this testimony is false, we may call in question all historical
   testimony whatever; for what facts ever have been so fully attested?

   But why should this testimony he rejected? No reason has ever been
   assigned, except that the facts, were miraculous; but we have shown,
   that it is not unreasonable to expect miracles in such a case; and that
   miracles are capable of satisfactory proof from testimony. It is,
   therefore, a just conclusion, That the Miracles of the Gospel are
   credible.

CHAPTER VIII.

   THE BIBLE CONTAINS PREDICTIONS OF EVENTS, WHICH NO HUMAN SAGACITY COULD
   HAVE FORESEEN, AND WHICH HAVE BEEN EXACTLY AND REMARKABLY ACCOMPLISHED.

   THE subject of prophecy is so extensive, and the difficulty of
   presenting, with brevity, the argument which it furnishes, so great,
   that if I had not determined to give a general outline of the evidences
   of revelation, I should have omitted this topic, as one to to which
   justice cannot be done, in so short an essay.

   But, I would not be understood as intimating, that the evidence from
   prophecy is of an inferior kind. So far from believing this to be the
   fact, I am persuaded, that whoever will take the pains to examine the
   subject thoroughly, will find that this source of evidence for the
   truth of revelation, is exceeded by no other, in the firmness of
   conviction which it is calculated to produce. Prophecy possesses, as a
   proof of divine revelation, some advantages which axe peculiar. For the
   proof of miracles we must have recourse to ancient testimony; but the
   fulfilling of prophecy may fall under our own observation, or may be
   conveyed to us by living witnesses. The evidence of miracles cannot, in
   any case, become stronger than it was at .first; but that of prophecy
   is continually increasing, and will go on increasing, until the whole
   scheme of predictions are fulfilled. The mere publication of a
   prediction furnishes no decisive evidence, that it is a revelation from
   God: it is the accomplishment which completes the proof. As prophecies
   have been fulfilled in every age, and are still in a course of being
   fulfilled; and as some most remarkable predictions remain to be
   accomplished, it is plain, from the nature of the case, that this proof
   will continue to increase in strength.

   It deserves to be well weighed, that any one prediction which has been
   fulfilled, is, of itself, a complete evidence of divine revelation; or
   to speak more properly, is itself a revelation. For, certainly, no one
   but God himself can foretell distant future events which depend
   entirely on the purpose of Him, "who worketh all things after the
   council of his own will."

   If then, we can adduce one prophecy, the accomplishment of which cannot
   be doubted, we have established the principle, that a revelation has
   been given; and if in one instance, and to one person, the probability
   is strong, that he is not the only person, who has been favored with
   such a communication.

   The remark, which is frequently made, that most prophecies are obscure,
   and the meaning very uncertain, will not affect the evidence arising
   from such as are perspicuous, and of which the accomplishment is exact.
   There are good reasons, why these future events should sometimes be
   wrapped up in the covering of strong figures and symbolical language;
   so that often the prophet himself, probably, did not understand the
   meaning of the prediction which he uttered. It was not intended, that
   they should be capable of being dearly interpreted, until the key was
   furnished, by the completion. If these observations are just, the study
   (of the prophecies will become more and more interesting, every day;
   and they will shed more and more light on the truth of the Scriptures.

   What I shall attempt at present, and all that is compatible with the
   narrow limits of this discourse, will be to exhibit a few remarkable
   predictions, and refer to the events, in which they have been
   fulfilled. They who wish for further satisfaction, will find it, in the
   perusal of Bishop Newton's excellent Dissertations on the prophecies,
   to which I acknowledge myself indebted for a considerable part of what
   is contained in this chapter.

   The first prophecies which I will produce; are those of Moses,
   respecting the Jews. They are recorded, principally, in the xxvi.
   chapter of Leviticus, and in the xxviii. chapter of Deutoronomy; of
   which, the following predictions deserve our attention.

   1. The Lord shall bring, a nation against thee from afar, from the end
   of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou
   shalt not understand. This prophecy had an accomplishment, both in the
   invasion of Judea by the Chaldeans, and by the Romans; but more
   especially, the latter. Jeremiah, when predicting the invasion of the
   Chaldeans, uses nearly the same language as Moses. Lo, I will bring a
   nation upon you from afar, O house of Israel, saith the Lord, it is an
   ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not. [19] --And
   again, Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven. [20]

   But with still greater propriety may it be said, that the Romans were a
   nation from afar; the rapidity of whose conquests resembled the eagle's
   flight; the standard of whose armies was au eagle; and whose language
   was unknown to the Jews.

   The enemies of the Jews are also characterized as a nation of fierce
   countenance, who shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor
   to the young. Which was an exact description of the Chaldeans. It is
   said, 2 Chron. xxxvi. 17, that God brought upon the Jews, the king of
   the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of
   their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
   man, or him that stooped for age. Such also were the Romans. Josephus
   informs us, that when Vespasian came to Gadara, "he slew all, man by
   man, the Romans showing mercy to no age." The like was done at Gamala.

   2. It was predicted, also, that their cities should be besieged and
   taken. And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
   fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst. This was fulfilled when
   Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came against Samaria, and besieged it:
   [21] when Sennacherib came up against all the fenced cities of Judah;
   and when Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem and burned the temple, and broke
   down the walls of Jerusalem round about. [22] The Jews had great
   confidence in the strength of the fortifications of Jerusalem. And
   Tacitus, as well as Josephus, describes it as a very strong place; yet
   it was often besieged and taken, before its final destruction by Titus.

   In their sieges they were to suffer much by famine, in the straitness
   wherewith their enemies should distress them. Accordingly, at Samaria,
   during the the siege, there was a great famine, so that an asses head
   was sold for four score pieces of silver. [23]

   And when Jerusalem was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar, the famine prevailed
   in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. [24]
   And in the siege of the same city by the Romans, there was a most
   distressing famine. [25]

   It was foretold, that in these famines, women should eat their own
   children. Ye shall eat, says Moses, the flesh of your sons and of your
   daughters. And again, thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body. [26]
   The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set
   the sole of her foot upon the ground, for delicateness and
   tenderness--she shall eat her children for want of all things, secretly
   in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress
   thee in thy gates. This extraordinary prediction was fulfilled, six
   hundred years after it. was spoken, in the siege of Samaria, by the
   king of Syria; when two women agreed together to give up their children
   to be eaten; and one of them was eaten accordingly. [27] It was
   fulfilled again, nine hundred years after Moses, in the siege of
   Jerusalem, by the Chaldeans. The hands of the pitiful women, says
   Jeremiah, have sodden their own children. [28] And again, fifteen
   hundred years after the time of Moses, when Jerusalem was besieged by
   the Romans, Josephus informs us, of a noble woman killing and eating
   her own sucking child, and when she had eaten half; she secreted the
   other part for another meal.

   3. Great numbers of the Jews were to be destroyed. And ye shall be left
   few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude. In
   the siege of Jerusalem, by Titus, it is computed that eleven hundred
   thousand persons perished, by famine, pestilence, and sword. Perhaps,
   since the creation of the world, so many persons never perished in any
   one siege as this.

   The occasion of so great a multitude of people being found at
   Jerusalem, was, that the siege commenced about the celebration of the
   passover; and the people throughout the adjacent country, took refuge
   in Jerusalem, at the approach of the Roman army.

   Moses also predicted, that the Jews should be carried back to Egypt,
   and sold as slaves, for a very low price, and described the method of
   their conveyance thither; And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt
   again with ships, where you shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen
   and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you. Josephus informs us, that when
   the city was taken, the captives who were above seventeen years of age,
   were sent to the works in Egypt: but so little care was taken of these
   captives, that eleven thousand of them perished for want. There is
   every probability, though the historian does not mention the fact, that
   they were conveyed to Egypt, in ships, as the Romans had then a fleet
   in the Mediterranean. The market was so overstocked, that there were no
   purchasers, and they were sold for the merest trifle.

   4. It is, moreover, predicted in this wonderful prophecy of Moses, that
   the Jews should be extirpated from their own land, and dispersed among
   all nations. And ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou
   goest to possess it. And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people,
   from one end of the earth, even unto the other.

   How remarkably this has been fulfilled, is known to all. The ten tribes
   were first carried away from their own land, by the King of Assyria;
   and next, the two other tribes were carried captive to Babylon; and,
   finally, when the Romans took away their place and nation, their
   dispersion was complete.

   Afterwards, Adrian forbade the Jews, by a public edict, to set foot in
   Jerusalem, on pain of death; or even to approach the country around it.
   In the time Of Tertullian and Jerome, they were prohibited from
   entering into Judea. And from that day to this, the number of Jews, in
   the holy land, has been very small. They are still exiles from their
   own land, and are found scattered through almost every country on the
   globe.

   5. But it is foretold, that, notwithstanding their dispersion, they
   should not be totally destroyed, but should exist still, as a distinct
   people. And yet for all Mat, when they be in the land of their enemies,
   I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them; to destroy them
   utterly, and to break my covenant with them. "What a marvellous thing
   is this," says Bishop Newton, "that after so many wars, battles, and
   sieges; after so many rebellions, massacres, and persecutions; after so
   many years of captivity, slavery, and misery; they are not destroyed
   utterly, and though scattered among all people, yet subsist a distinct
   people by themselves! where is any thing like this to be found in all
   the histories, and in all the nations under the sun?"

   The prophecy goes on to declare, that they should he; every where, in
   an uneasy condition; and should not rest long, in any one place. And
   among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of
   thy foot have rest. How exactly this has been verified, in the case of
   this unhappy people, even unto this day, is known to all. There is
   scarcely a country in Europe, from which they have not been banished,
   at one time or another. To say nothing of many previous scenes of
   bloodshed and banishment, of the most shocking kind, through which,
   great multitudes of this devoted people passed, in Germany, France, and
   Spain, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; eight hundred
   thousand Jews, are said by the Spanish historian, to have been banished
   from Spain, by Ferdinand and Isabella. And how often, when tolerated by
   government, they have suffered by the tumults of the people, it is
   impossible to enumerate.

   The prophet declares, That they should be oppressed and crushed alway;
   that their sons and their daughters should be given to another people;
   that they should be mad for the sight of their eyes, which they should
   see. Nothing has been more common in all countries, where the Jews has
   resided, than to fine, fleece, and oppress them at will; and in Spain
   and Portugal, their children have been taken from them, by order of the
   government, to be educated in the Popish religion. The instances, also,
   in which their oppressions have driven them to madness and desperation,
   are too numerous to be here stated in detail.

   6. Finally, it is foretold by Moses, That they should become an
   astonishment, a proverb, and a by-word, among all nations; and that
   their plagues should be wonderful, even great plagues, and of long
   continuance. In every country the Jews are hated and despised. They
   have been literally a proverb, and a by-word. Mohammedans, Heathens,
   and Christians, however they differ in other things, have been agreed
   in vilifying, abusing, and persecuting the Jews. Surely, the judgments
   visited on this peculiar people, have been wonderful, and of long
   continuance. For nearly eighteen hundred years, they have been in this
   miserable state of banishment, dispersion, and persecution.

   "What nation," says the distinguished writer already quoted, "hath
   subsisted as a distinct people in their own country, so long, as these
   have done in their dispersion, into all countries? And what a standing
   miracle is this exhibited to the view and observation of the whole
   world!"--"Here are instances of prophecies delivered above three
   thousand years ago, and yet., as we see, fulfilling in the world, at
   this very time; and what stronger proof can we desire of the divine
   legation of Moses? How these instances may affect others, I know not,
   but for myself, I must acknowledge, they not only convince, but amaze
   and astonish me beyond expression."

   The prophecies, in the Old Testament, concerning Nineveh, Babylon,
   Tyre, and Egypt, are highly deserving our attention; not only because
   they are expressed in the plainest language, but because the fulfilment
   of them has not been confined to one age, but has continued for
   thousands of years, and is as remarkable at this time, as in any former
   period; but the narrow limits which we have prescribed to ourselves,
   forbid our entering on this subject.

   It may be safely affirmed, however, that the more closely these
   prophecies are compared with subsequent events--events altogether
   improbable in themselves, and of a truly extraordinary character--the
   more dearly will the impartial and discerning see in them, marks of a
   divine origin.

   The prophecy of Isaiah respecting Cyrus, by name, two hundred years
   before he was born, is very clear, and no less remarkable.

   "That saith of Cyrus, he is my shepherd and shall perform all my
   pleasure, even saying to Jerusalem, thou shalt be built, and to the
   temple, thy fonndation shall be laid. Thus saith the Lord to Cyrus Isis
   anointed, to Cyrus whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations
   before him, and I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the
   two leaved gates, that shall not be shut. I will go before thee and
   make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of
   brass, and will cut in sunder the bars of iron, and I will give thee
   the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that
   thou mayest know, that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name, am the
   God of Israel. For Jacob, my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I
   have even called thee by thy name, I have surnamed thee, though thou
   hast not known me. [29] "

   We are informed by Josephus, that after Cyrus had got possession of
   Babylon, this prophecy was shown to him; and that he was struck with
   admiration at the manifest divinity of the writing. Besides the name of
   Cyrus, two extraordinary events are foretold; the capture of Babylon,
   with its iron bars and gates of brass, and containing hidden
   treasures;--and the restoration of the Jews, and the rebuilding of
   their city and temple. And every thing is so plain, that there is no
   possibility of evading the. force of the argument.

   The prophecies recorded in the book of Daniel; also, are very
   wonderful. There we have described, the rise and fall of four
   successive monarchies, or empires; also, a .prophecy concerning the
   conquests of Alexander the Great, and concerning his successors,
   embracing so many particulars, that. it assumes the appearance of a
   history of the events which it predicts. Porphyry, an early and learned
   opposer of Christianity, was so struck with the coincidence between the
   predictions, and the history of the events by which they are fulfilled;
   that he declared that the prophecy must have been written after the
   events occurred. The infidel can make no complaint of obscurity here,
   as he commonly does, when prophecies are adduced; the objection now is,
   that the prediction is too manifest, and circumstantial. This objection
   of Porphyry, induced Jerome to use the following pertinent language:
   "Cujus impugnatio testimonium veritatis est. Tanta enim dictorum fides
   fuit, ut propheta incredulis hominibus non videatur futura dixisse, sed
   narrasse, præterita." The meaning of which is, "This objection is a
   testimony to the truth; for such is the perspicuity of the language,
   that the prophet, in the opinion of infidel men, seems rather to be
   narrating past events, than predicting those which are future."

   It will be sufficient to observe, that there is not the least
   foundation for this opinion of Porphyry, that the book of Daniel was
   written after the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. Josephus relates, that
   the prophecies of Daniel were shown to Alexander the Great, when he
   visited Jerusalem; and that this was the reason of his granting so many
   privileges to the Jewish people. However this may be, Daniel is spoken
   of in the first book of Maccabees; and Josephus himself reckons him
   among the greatest of prophets. And if they had been written at that
   late period, they never could have found a place in the Jewish canon,
   as the prophecies of Daniel. These prophecies are also recognised and
   quoted by Jesus Christ, as the productions of Daniel.

   The prophecies which relate to the Messiah are so numerous and
   interesting, and involve so much critical discussion, that to exhibit
   them in their proper light, a volume would scarcely be sufficient. I
   must, therefore, be contented to refer to the most remarkable of these
   predictions, in a very brief and general way.

   1. It is plain, from a cursory perusal of the Old Testament, that
   frequent intimations are given of the coming of a remarkable personage.
   From these, the Jewish nation have been led, in all ages, to entertain
   the expectation of a Messsiah; and from them, the idea of a
   distinguished person who was to proceed from Judea, seems to have
   pervaded the surrounding nations. Some of the passages of Scripture, on
   which this opinion was founded, were, the promise of The seed of the
   woman;--The seed of Abraham in whom all nations should be blessed;--The
   Shiloh who was to come out of Judah, before the dominion of that tribe
   should depart.--The prophet like unto Moses, whom the Lord would raise
   up;--The king whom the Lord would set upon his holy hill;--The priest
   after the order of Melchisedek; The anointed One, or Messiah--The
   righteous branch--The corner stone--The desire of all nations--The
   Shepherd of Israel.

   2. The time of the arrival of the Messiah is designated in prophecy. He
   was to come before the sceptre departed from Judah, at the end of
   seventy prophetic weeks, or four hundred and ninety years, from the
   time of the going forth of the command, to restore and build Jerusalem,
   and while the second temple was yet standing.

   3. The place of his birth, and the family from which he was to descend,
   were also explicitly mentioned in prophecy. From the evangelical
   history, and from the acknowledgment of the Jews, it is evident, that
   they well knew, that the Messiah was to be born at Bethlehem, and to be
   of the family of David:

   4. Things of an apparently contradictory nature: are predicted
   concerning the Messiah. At one time he is represented as a king and
   conqueror, whose dominion would be co-extensive with the earth, and'
   who would flourish in righteousness and peace forever; at another, he
   is exhibited as one despised and rejected; a man of sorrow and grief;
   as wounded and bruised;--as cut of out of the land of the; and as
   pouring out his soul unto death. These apparently irreconcilable
   characters, led the Jews at one time, to entertain the opinion, that
   two Messiahs were predicted; the one a triumphant conqueror; the other
   a persecuted and patient sufferer.. But, however great the apparent
   inconsistency, there is an exact accomplishment of both characters, in
   Jesus of Nazareth. And, certainly, the same cannot be said of any other
   person who ever lived.

   5. It is predicted of the Messiah, that he should be a light to the
   Gentiles; and that under his administration, the face of the world
   should be changed; and that peace and righteousness should prevail.
   Although this prophecy is only in part fulfilled, yet so much has been
   accomplished in the call of numerous Gentile nations to the standard of
   the Messiah, and in the benign and salutary influence of Christianity,
   that we must conclude that it was uttered under the influence of
   inspiration.

   6. It was not only predicted, that Messiah should be cut off, but it is
   expressly stated, that he should die as a vicarious sacrifice--an
   expiatory victim for sin and transgression. "Thou shalt make his soul
   an offering for sin."

   For the fulfilling of these predictions, I need only refer to the New
   Testament.

   That there is a remarkable coincidence between the language of the
   prophets and the history of the evangelists, cannot be denied, however
   it may be accounted for. The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah has a
   counterpart in the sufferings and death of Christ, which has forced
   conviction on the minds of many unbelievers.

   But there are also many particular facts and circumstances foretold
   respecting the Messiah, which it may be proper, briefly to mention. His
   forerunner, John the Baptist, is predicted by Isaiah and Malachi. His
   miracles, his uncomplaining meekness and tranquil submission under
   cruel sufferings, by Isaiah. His riding on an ass, and a colt the foal
   of an ass;--his being pierced where the wound should be visible.;--his
   being sold for thirty pieces of silver, which should be, appropriated
   to buy the Potter's Field, by Zechariah. It is predicted in the Psalms,
   that they would part his raiment and cast lots for his vesture; and
   that vinegar would be given to him to drink. The very words, also,
   which he uttered on the cross, when forsaken of God, are set down in
   the xxii. Psalm, v. 1.

   It was also predicted in the Law of Moses, by an expressive type, that
   not a bone of Icing should be broken; the fulfilment of which was
   wonderful, since the legs of both those crucified with him were broken.

   Isaiah foretold, that he should make his grave with the wicked, and
   with the rich in his death, which was literally accomplished, when
   Jesus Christ was suspended on the between two thieves; and when he was
   taken down from the cross, by a rich man, and buried by him, in his own
   new tomb.

   The most of these particulars were fulfilled by the free actions of the
   enemies of Jesus, who had no idea that they were fulfilling any divine
   prophecy. It is impossible, that so many circumstances, literally
   predicted, should have been fulfilled by a mere fortuitous concurrence.

   The truth is, the whole ritual law is a prophecy of Jesus. To him the
   whole Old Testament dispensation had reference. The Law, the Psalms,
   and the Prophets, all testify of him. As said the angel to St. John,
   "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."

   Christ himself delivered, while upon earth, many clear and remarkable
   prophecies. Most of his parables have a prophetic character, and in a
   striking manner represented the Gospel, the rejection of the Jews, the
   calling of the Gentiles, and the future condition of the Church. He
   also foretold, in express words, the treatment which his followers
   should receive from the world, the treachery of Judas Iscariot, the
   conduct of Peter in denying him three times in one night, and the
   particular circumstances and exact manner of his own death, and also
   his resurrection on the third day. But I must pass over all these, at
   present, and confine my attention to that astonishing prophecy, which
   Jesus delivered to his disciples on Mount Olivet, concerning the utter
   destruction of the temple of Jerusalem, and of the whole Jewish,
   nation. This prediction was uttered about forty years before the events
   occurred, to which it relates; and was recorded by St. Matthew,
   according to the common opinion of early writers, thirty, or at least
   twenty years before it was fulfilled. The same was recorded by Mark,
   and Luke, a few years after the writing of Matthew's Gospel, but
   several years before the occurrence of those prodigious things, which
   are foretold in it. The testimony of antiquity is, that both these
   evangelists were dead before the invasion of Judea, by the Romans. John
   was the only one of the evangelists, or perhaps of the apostles, who
   lived to witness the fulfilling of his Lord's prophecy; and it is
   remarkable, that in his Gospel, this subject is never mentioned.

   Let it be remembered, that when this prophecy was delivered by our
   Saviour, there was not the least human probability of such an event, as
   the destruction of Jerusalem. The Jews were in a state of profound
   peace; and the power of the Romans was such, that it could not have
   been conjectured, that one small nation would think of rebelling
   against them.

   The words of this prophecy may be read in the xxiv. chapter of the
   Gospel of Matthew; also in the xiii. chapter of the Gospel of Mark; and
   in the xix. and xxi chapters of the Gospel of Luke.

   I will first collect into one view, all the most remarkable particulars
   of this prophecy, and then show how they were fulfilled. The
   predictions relate, 1. to the signs and precursors of the desolation of
   the holy city; 2. to the circumstances of its siege and capture; and 3.
   to the consequences of this tremendous catastrophe.

   1. The signs and precusors of this event were to be, false
   Christs,--seditions and wars,--famines, pestilences, earthquakes, and
   extraordinary appearances in the heavens;--the persecution of
   Christians;--the apostacy of professors; and the great want of charity
   and depravation of morals among the people.

   2. The circumstances of this tremendous judgment of heaven, are such as
   these: the event should occur before the existing generation had
   completely passed away;--that it should be brought on by a war waged
   against the Jews, by a heathen nation, bearing idolatrous
   ensigns:--that Jerusalem should be utterly destroyed, and the temple so
   completely demolished, that one stone of that. sacred edifice, should
   not be left on another:--that multitudes should perish by the
   sword:--that great numbers should be carried away captives:--that the
   distress should exceed any thing, which had ever occurred in the
   world;--and that the divine wrath should be manifest in all these
   calamities, as it is called the day of vengeance; and it is said, that
   there should be wrath against the people.

   3. The consequences of the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem, as
   predicted by Christ, were to be, the dispersion of the Jews through all
   the nations;--the total overthrow of the Jewish commonwealth, which is
   expressed by the prophetic symbols of the sun being darkened, the moon
   not giving her light, and the stars falling from heaven;--the rejection
   of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles;--the rising of false
   prophets, and false Messiahs;--the extent and continuance of these
   judgments on the Jewish nation; with some intimation of their
   restoration. The escape of the Christians from these calamities, is
   also foretold, and directions given for their flight; and on their
   account, it is promised, that those days should be shortened; and
   finally, it is predicted that the Gospel should be preached among alt
   nations.

   Let us now proceed to inquire, in what manner these numerous and
   extraordinary predictions were accomplished; and we cannot but remark,
   that it seems to have been ordered, specially, by Providence, that the
   history of the series of events by which this prophecy was fulfilled,
   should be written by a man who was not a Christian; and who was an
   eye-witness of the facts, which he records. I allude to the Jewish
   historian, Josephus, who is an author of high respectability, and of
   great value to the cause of Christianity.

   1. In regard to false Christs, of which the prophecy speaks so
   emphatically, we learn from the historian, just mentioned, that
   impostors and magicians drew multitudes after them, into the
   wilderness, promising to show them signs and wonders, some of whom
   became deranged, and others were punished by Felix, the procurator. One
   a these impostors was, that Egyptian, spoken of in the Acts of the
   Apostles, who drew multitudes of people after him to Mount Olivet,
   promising that he would cause the walls of Jerusalem to fall down at
   his word.

   Theudas was another, who pretended to be a prophet, and gave out that
   he would divide the waters of Jordan; but he was quickly routed by
   Cuspius Fadus, and all his followers scattered. The impostor himself
   was taken alive, and his head cut off, and brought to Jerusalem. In the
   reign of Nero, and during the time that Felix was procurator of Judea,
   impostors arose in such numbers, that the historian informs us, "many
   of them were apprehended and killed every day."

   There were also, at this time, great commotions, and horrible seditions
   and wars, in various places; as at Cesarea, Alexandria, and Babylonia.
   There were great contentions between the Jews and Samaritans; and also
   between the Jews and people of other nations, who dwelt in the same
   cities with them. Both Josephus and Philo, give a particular account of
   these disturbances, in which multitudes of the people were slain.

   Famines, pestilences, and earthquakes, are mentioned by Suetonius, and
   by several other profane historians, who are cited by Eusebius, by
   Josephus, by Tacitus, and by Seneca.

   That prodigies were frequent, is expressly asserted, by Josephus and
   Tacitus. The former declares that a star hung over the city like a
   sword, for a whole year;--that at the ninth hour of the night, a bright
   light shone round the altar and the temple, so that for the space of
   half an hour, it appeared to be bright day;--that the eastern gate of
   the temple, which it required twenty men to shut, and which was
   fastened by strong bars and bolts, opened of its own accord:--that
   before sun set, there was seen in the clouds, the appearance of
   chariots and armies fighting;--that at the feast of Pentecost, while
   the priests were going into the inner temple, a voice was heard, as of
   a multitude, saying, Let us depart hence. And what affected the people
   more than any thing else, was, that four years before the war began, a
   countryman came to Jerusalem, at the feast of Tabernacles, and ran up
   and own, crying day and night, "A voice from the east, a voice from the
   west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the
   temple. Wo! Wo! to Jerusalem?" It was in vain that by stripes and
   torture the magistrates attempted to restrain him: he continued crying,
   especially at the public festivals, for seven years and five months,
   and yet never grew hoarse, nor appeared to be weary: until during the
   siege, while he was crying on the wall, a stone struck him, and killed
   him instantly. Tacitus, the Roman historian, joins his testimony to
   that of Josephus:--"Armies," says he, "were seen engaged in the
   heavens, the glittering of arms was observed; and suddenly the fire
   from the clouds illuminated the temple; the doors of the inner temple
   were suddenly thrown open; and a voice more than human was heard
   proclaiming, the gods are departing: and at the same time, the motion
   of their departure was perceived." Men may form what judgment they
   please of these narratives; but one thing is certain, that the minds of
   men were, about this time, much agitated and terrified with what
   appeared to them to be prodigies. There were, fearful sights, and great
   signs from heaven.

   2. The circumstances accompanying the siege and rapture of the city,
   were as exactly foretold, as the preceding signs. "The abomination of
   desolation," spoken of by Daniel the prophet, was nothing else than the
   Roman armies, whose ensign was an eagle perched upon a spear: which
   ensigns were worshipped, as divinities. These stood where "they ought
   not," when they were planted, not only in the holy land, but on the
   consecrated spot, where the temple had stood. But the Christians had
   been warned, at the first appearance of this desolating abomination,
   immediately to betake themselves to flight; which they did, and instead
   of going into the city, they retired to Pella, beyond Jordan.

   The distress of the Jews, within the city, during the siege, where two
   or three millions of people were crowded into a narrow space, almost
   exceeds belief. What with their continual battles with the Romans; what
   with intestine feuds and tumults; and what with famine and pestilence,
   the sufferings which they endured, cannot now be conceived. No such
   distress was ever experienced by any people, before or since.

   Jerusalem was hemmed in on all sides, by the besieging army, and
   notwithstanding the great strength of its fortifications, was taken.
   Although Titus had given express orders, that the temple should be
   preserved; yet the mouth of the Lord, had declared, that it should be
   otherwise: and, accordingly, it was burnt to the ground, and the very
   foundation dug up by the soldiers, with the hope of finding hidden
   treasures. After the city had been destroyed, Titus ordered the whole
   space to be levelled like a field; so that a person approaching the
   place, would hardly suspect that it had ever been inhabited.

   The number slain in the war has already been mentioned; to which we may
   now add, that the captives amounted to ninety-seven thousand. Josephus,
   in relating these events, adopts a language remarkably similar to that
   used by Christ, in the prophecy. "The calamities of all people," says
   he, "from the creation of the world, if they be compared with those
   suffered by the Jews, will be found to be far surpassed by them." The
   words of Christ are; There shall be great tribulation, such as was not
   from the beginning of the world to this time; no, nor ever shall be.

   That these unparalleled calamities proceeded from the vengeance of
   heaven, against a people whose iniquities were full, was not only
   acknowledged by Josephus, but by Titus, the Roman general. After taking
   a survey of the city, the height of the towers and walls, the magnitude
   of the stones, and the strength of the bands by which they were held
   together, he broke out into the following exclamation: "By the help of
   God, we have brought this war to a conclusion. It was God, who drew out
   the Jews from these fortifications; for what could the hands, or
   military engines of men, avail, against such towers as these?" And he
   refused to be crowned, after the victory, saying, "That he was not the
   author of this achievement, but the anger of God against the Jews, was
   what put the victory into his hands."

   3. Finally, the consequences of this catastrophe were as distinctly
   predicted, and as accurately fulfilled, as the preceding events. The
   Jews, who survived, were dispersed over the world, in which condition
   they continue until this day. The Christians, availing themselves of
   the warnings of their Lord, escaped all the calamities of the siege.
   Jerusalem was trodden down of the Gentiles; and continues thus to be
   trodden down, until this day.

   Jerusalem was rebuilt by Adrian, but not precisely on the old site; and
   was called Ælia, which name it bore, until the time of Constantine. The
   apostate Julian, out of hatred to Christianity, and with the view of
   defeating the prediction, "That Jerusalem should be trodden down by the
   Gentiles," determined to restore the Jews, and rebuild their temple.
   Immense sums were appropriated for the work; the superintendence of
   which was assigned to one of his lieutenants; and the governor of the
   province to which Jerusalem belonged, assisted in it. "But horrible
   balls of fire, bursting forth from the foundations, rendered the place
   inaccessible to the workmen, who were often much burnt, so that the
   enterprise was laid aside." The account now given is attested by Julian
   himself, and his favorite heathen historian, Ammianus. The witnesses
   are indeed numerous, and unexceptionable; "Annnianus Marcellinus, a
   heathen; Zemach David, a Jew, who confesses that Julian was, divinitus
   impeditus, providentially hindered, in his attempt; Nazianzen and
   Chrysostom, among the Greeks; Ambrose and Ruffin, among the Latins; all
   of whom flourished, at the very time when this wonderful event
   occurred. Theodoret, Socrates, Sozomen, and Philostorgius, respectable
   historians, recorded it within fifty years after the event; and while
   the eye witnesses of the fact were still surviving." [30] That part of
   the prophecy, which relates to the restoration of the Jews, remains to
   be accomplished, and we hope the accomplishment is not far distant.
   When this event shall take place, the evidence from this prophecy will
   be complete, and almost irresistible. This shall occur when "The times
   of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled." The circumstances of this glorious
   event, are more particularly described by Paul, in his Epistle to the
   Romans, chap. xi. "If the fall if them be the riches. of the world, and
   the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their
   fulness? for I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
   mystery, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the
   fulness of the Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved."
   The preaching of the Gospel to all nations, has been considered in
   another place.

   After this concise review of some remarkable prophecies contained in
   the Bible, is there any one, who can persuade himself, that all these
   coincidences are accidental? or that the whole is a cunningly, devised
   fable? That man must indeed be blind, who cannot see "This Light which
   shineth in a dark place:"--"This SURE WORD OF PROPHECY, which holy men
   of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

CHAPTER IX.

   NO OTHER RELIGION POSSESSES THE SAME KIND AND DEGREE OF EVIDENCE AS
   CHRISTIANITY: AND NO OTHER MIRACLES ARE AS WELL ATTESTED, AS THOSE
   RECORDED IN THE BIBLE.

   HAVING given a brief view of the external evidences of Christianity, it
   is now proper to inquire, whether any system of religion, ancient or
   modern, is as well supported by evidence; and whether, other miracles
   have testimony in their favor, as satisfactory, as that by which the
   miracles of the Gospel are accompanied.

   The usual declamation of infidel writers, on this subject, is
   calculated to make the impression on unsuspicious readers, that all
   religions are similar in their origin;--that they all lay claim to
   miracles and divine communications;--and that all stand upon an equal
   footing. But when we descend to particulars, and inquire, what
   religions that now exist, or ever did exist, profess to rest their
   claims on well attested miracles, and the exact accomplishment, of
   prophecy, none besides the Jewish and Christian can be produced. Among
   the multiform systems of Paganism, there is not one, which was founded
   on manifest miracles or prophecies. They had, indeed, their prodigies
   and their oracles, by which the credulous multitude were deceived; and
   their founders pretended to have received revelations, or to have held
   communion with the gods. But what well attested miraculous fact can be
   produced, from all the religions of the heathen world? What oracle ever
   gave responses so clear and free from ambiguity, as to furnish
   evidence, that the knowledge of futurity was possessed? It is easy to
   pretend to divine revelation: this is done by every fanatic.

   It is not disputed, that many impostors have appeared in the world, as
   well as many deluded fanatics. But the reason why all their claims and
   pretensions may with propriety be rejected, is, that they were not able
   to exhibit any satisfactory evidence, that they were commissioned from
   heaven, to instruct mankind in religion.

   In this we are all agreed. Of what use, therefore, can it be, to bring
   up these impostures and delusions, when the evidences of the Christian
   religion are under consideration? Can it be a reason for rejecting a
   religion which comes well attested, that there have been innumerable
   false pretensions to divine revelation? Must miracles, supported by
   abundant testimony, be discredited, because there have been reports of
   prodigies and miracles which have no evidence? And because heathen
   oracles have given answers to inquiries respecting future events, dark,
   indeterminate, and designedly ambiguous; shall we place no confidence
   in numerous authentic prophecies, long ago committed to writing, which
   have been most exactly and wonderfully accomplished?

   It is alleged, that the early history of all ancient nations is
   fabulous, and abounds in stories of incredible prodigies; and hence it
   is inferred, that the miracles of the Old and New Testament, should be
   considered in the same light. To which it may be replied, that this
   general consent of nations, that miracles have existed, is favorable to
   the opinion that true miracles have at some time occurred. It may again
   be observed, that the history of Moses, which is more than a thousand
   years older than any profane history, has every deuce of being a true
   relation of facts;--and, moreover, that the age in which the miracles
   of the New Testament were performed, so far from being a dark and
   fabulous age, was the most enlightened period of the heathen world. It
   was the age of the most celebrated historians, orators, and poets.
   There never was a time, when it would have been more difficult to gain
   a general belief in miracles, which had no sufficient testimony, than
   in the Augustan, and succeeding age. Not only did learning flourish;
   but there was at that period, a general tendency to skepticism and
   atheism. There can evidently, therefore, be no inference unfavorable to
   Christianity, derived from the belief of unfounded stories of
   miraculous events, in the dark ages of antiquity. The only effect of
   the prevalence of false accounts of miracles, should be, to produce
   caution and careful examination into the evidence of every report of
   this kind. Reason dictates, that truth and falsehood should never be
   confounded. Let every fact be subjected to the test of a rigid
   scrutiny, and let it stand or fall, according as it. is supported or
   unsupported by testimony. If the miracles of the Bible have no better
   evidence than the prodigies of the heathen, they ought to receive no
   more credit; but if they have solid evidence, they ought not to be
   confounded with reports which carry imposture on their very face; or,
   at least, have no credible testimony in their favor.

   There is no other way of deciding on facts, which occurred long since,
   but by testimony. And the truth of Christianity is really a matter of
   fact. In support of it, we have adduced testimony which cannot be
   invalidated; and we challenge our opponents to show, that any other
   religion stands on the same firm basis. Instead of this, they would
   amuse us with vague declamations on the credulity of man, and the many
   fabulous stories which have been circulated and believed. But what has
   this to do with the question? We admit all this, and maintain that it
   does not furnish the semblance of an argument against the truth of the
   well attested facts, recorded by the evangelists. Because there is much
   falsehood in the world, is there no such thing as. truth? It would be
   just as reasonable to conclude, that, because many men have been
   convicted of false, hood, there were no persons of veracity in the
   world; or that because there were many knaves, all pretensions, to
   honesty were unfounded.

   The Mohammedan religion is frequently brought forward by the enemies of
   revelation, with an air of confidence, as though the pretensions and
   success of that impostor, would derogate from the evidences of
   Christianity. It is expedient, therefore, to bring this, subject under
   a particular examination. And here, let it be observed, that we do not
   reject any timing, respecting the origin and progress of this religion,
   which has been transmitted to us by competent and credible witnesses.
   We admit that Mohammed existed, and was the founder of a new sect; and,
   that from a small be, ginning, his religion spread with astonishing
   rapidity over the fairest portion of the globe. We admit, also, that he
   was the author of the Koran, which he composed, from time to time,
   probably with the aid of some one or two, other persons. Moreover, it
   is admitted;, that he was an extraordinary man, and prosecuted the.
   bold scheme which he had projected, with uncommon perseverance and
   address. Neither are we disposed to deny, that the Koran contains many
   sublime passages, relative to God and his perfections, and many sound
   and salutary precepts of morality. That the language is elegant, and a
   standard of purity in the Arabic tongue, has been asserted by all
   Mohammedan writers, and conceded by many learned Christians. But as to
   his pretended revelations, there is no external evidence, whatever,
   that they were real; and there is an overwhelming weight of internal
   evidence, that they are not from God.

   To bring this subject fairly before us, let the following
   considerations be impartially weighed:

   1. The pretensions of Mohammed were supported by no miracles, or
   prophecies. Ile was often called upon by his opposers to confirm his
   mission, by this decisive proof; but he always declined making the
   attempt; and resorted to various excuses and subterfuges. In the Koran,
   God is introduced, as saying, "Nothing hindered us from sending thee
   with miracles, except that the former nations have charged them with
   imposture:--thou art a preacher only." Again, "That if he did perform
   miracles, the people would not believe, as they had before rejected
   Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, who performed them."

   Dr. Paley [31] has enumerated thirteen different places in the Koran,
   where this objection is considered, in not one of which, it is alleged,
   that miracles had been performed for its confirmation. It is true, that
   this artful man told of things, sufficiently miraculous; but for the
   truth of these assertions, we have no manner of proof, except his own
   word, which, in this case, is worth nothing.

   Now, if it had been as easy a thing to obtain credit to stories of
   miracles, publicly performed, as some suppose, surely Mohammed would
   have had recourse to this measure, during the period, that he was so
   pressed and teased by his enemies, with a demand for this very
   evidence. But he had too much cunning to venture upon an expedient so
   dangerous: his opposers Would quickly have detected and exposed the
   cheat. At length, however, he so far yielded to the demand of his
   enemies, as to publish one of the most extravagant stories, which ever
   entered into the imagination of man; and solemnly swore that every word
   of it was true. I refer to his night journey to Jerusalem, and thence
   to heaven, under the guidance of the angel Gabriel. As this story may
   afford some amusement to the reader, I will subjoin, in a note, the
   substance of it, omitting those particulars which are most ridiculous
   and extravagant. [32]

   This marvellous story, however, had well nigh ruined his cause. His
   enemies treated it with deserved ridicule and scorn; and a number of
   his followers forsook him, from that time. In fact, it rendered his
   further continuance at Mecca, entirely inexpedient; and having before
   despatched some of his disciples to Medina, he betook himself, with his
   followers, to that city, where he met with a more cordial reception,
   than in his native place.

   The followers of Mohammed, hundreds of years after his death, related
   many miracles, which they pretended that he performed: but their report
   is not only unsupported by testimony, but is in direct contradiction to
   the Koran, where he repeatedly disclaims all pretensions to miraculous
   powers. And the miracles which they ascribe to him, while they are
   marvellous enough, are of that trifling and ludicrous kind, commonly to
   be met with in all forgeries, in which miracles are represented as
   having been performed; such as, that the trees walked to meet
   him;--that the stones saluted him;--that a beam groaned to him;--that a
   camel made complaint to him;--and that a shoulder of mutton told him
   that it was poisoned.

   It appears, then, that Mohammedanism has no evidence, whatever, but the
   declaration of the impostor. It is impossible, therefore, that.
   Christianity should be placed in a more favorable point of light, than
   in comparison with the religion of Mohammed. The one, as we have seen,
   rests on well attested miracles; the other does not exhibit the shadow
   of a proof, that it was derived from heaven.

   2. It is fair to compare the moral characters of the respective
   founders of these two religions. And here we have as perfect a contrast
   as history can furnish. Jesus Christ was, holy, harmless, undefiled,
   and separate from sinners. His life was pure, without a stain. His most
   bitter enemies could find no fault in him. He exhibited, through life,
   the most perfect example of disinterested zeal, pure benevolence, and
   unaffected humility, which the world ever saw. Mohammed was an
   ambitious, licentious, cruel, and unjust man. His life was stained with
   the most atrocious crimes. Blasphemy, perjury, murder, adultery, lust,
   and robbery, were actions of daily occurrence. And to shield himself
   from censure, and open a door for unbridled indulgence, he pretended
   revelations from heaven, to justify all his vilest practices. He had
   the effrontery to pretend, that God had given him privilege to commit,
   at pleasure, the most abominable crimes. The facts which could be
   adduced in support of these general charges, are so numerous, and so
   shocking, that I will not defile my paper, nor wound the feelings of
   the reader, by a recital of them.

   3. The Koran itself can never bear a comparison with the New Testament,
   in the view of any impartial person. It is a confused and incongruous
   heap of sublime sentiments, moral precepts, positive institutions,
   extravagant and ridiculous stories, and manifest lies and
   contradictions. Mohammed, himself, acknowledged, that it contained many
   contradictions; but he accounted for this fact by alleging, that what
   had been communicated to him in one chapter, was repealed in a
   subsequent one;--and so he charges this inconsistency on his Maker. The
   number of abrogated passages is so great, that a mussulman cannot be
   easily confuted by proving the falsehood of any declaration in the
   Koran; for, he will have recourse to this doctrine of abrogation. There
   is nothing in this book, which cannot easily be accounted for; nothing
   above the capacity of impostors to accomplish. It is artfully
   accommodated to the religions of Arabia, prevalent at the time. It
   gives encouragement to the strongest and most vicious passions of human
   nature; promotes ambition, despotism, revenge, and offensive war; opens
   wide the door of licentiousness; and holds out such rewards and
   punishments, as are calculated to make an impression on the minds of
   wicked men. It discourages, and indeed forbids, all free inquiry, and
   all discussion of the doctrines which it contains. Whatever is
   excellent in the Koran, is in imitation of the Bible; but wherever the
   author follows his own judgment, or indulges his own imagination, we
   find falsehood, impiety, or ridiculous absurdity. [33]

   4. The means by which the religion of Mohammed was propagated, were
   entirely different from those employed in the propagation of the
   Gospel. If there is any point of strong resemblance between these two
   systems, it consists merely in the circumstance of the rapid and
   extensive progress, and permanent continuance, of each. But when we
   come to consider the means by which this end was attained in the two
   cases, instead of resemblance we find again, a perfect contrast.
   Mohammed did, indeed, attempt, at first, to propagate his religion by
   persuasion and artifice; and these efforts he continued for twelve
   years, but with very small success. At the end of three years, he had
   gained no more than fourteen disciples; and at. the end of seven years,
   his followers amounted to little more than eighty; and at the end of
   twelve years, when he fled from Mecca, the number was very
   inconsiderable. As far, therefore, as there can be a fair comparison
   between the progress of Christianity and Mohammedanism; that is, during
   the time that Mohammed employed argument and persuasion alone, there is
   no resemblance. The progress of Christianity was like the lightning,
   which shineth from one part of heaven to the other; extending in a few
   years, not only without aid from learning and power, but in direct
   opposition to both, throughout the whole Roman empire, and far beyond
   its limits. But Mohammedanism, for twelve years, made scarcely any
   progress; yet it commenced among an ignorant and uncivilized people.
   During this period, the progress was scarcely equal to what might be
   expected from any artful impostor. This religion never spread in any
   other way than by the sword. As soon as the inhabitants of Medina
   declared in favor of Mohammed, he changed his whole plan, and gave out
   that he was directed to propagate his religion by force. From this
   time, he is found engaged in war. He began by attacking mercantile
   caravans, and, as his force increased, went on to conquer the petty
   kingdoms, into which Arabia was then divided. [34] Sometimes, he put
   all the prisoners to death, and at other times, sold them into slavery.
   At first, the order was, to massacre. every creature that refused to
   embrace his religion; but he became more lenient afterwards, especially
   to Jews and Christians. The alternative was, "The Koran, death, or
   tribute."

   But it is a great mistake, to suppose, that the conquests of Mohammed,
   himself, were very extensive. The fact is, that he, never, during his
   life, extended his dominion. beyond the limits of Arabia; except, that
   he overran one or two inconsiderable provinces of Syria. It was by the
   Caliphs, his successors, that so great a part of Asia, and Egypt, were
   brought into subjection. But what is there remarkable in these
   successes, more than those of other conquerors? Surely, the propagation
   of Mohammedanism by the sword, however rapid or extensive, can never
   bear any comparison with that of Christianity, by the mere force of
   truth, under the blessing of heaven.

   5. The tendency and effects of Mohammedanism, when compared with the
   tendency and effects of Christianity, serve to exhibit the latter in a
   very favorable light. The Christian religion has been a rich blessing
   to every country which has embraced it; and its salutary effects have
   borne proportion to the care which has been taken to inculcate its
   genuine principles, and the cordiality with which its doctrines have
   been embraced. if we cast our eyes over the map of the world, and
   inquire what nations are truly civilized? Where does learning flourish?
   Where are the principles of morality and the dictates of humanity best
   understood? Where are the poor and afflicted most effectually relieved?
   Where do men enjoy the greatest security of life, property, and
   liberty? Where is the female sex treated with due respect, and exalted
   to their proper place in society? Where is the education of youth most
   assiduously pursued? Where are the brightest examples of benevolence;
   and where do men enjoy most rational happiness?--I say, if we were
   called upon to designate those countries, in which these advantages
   are, moat highly enjoyed, every one of them would be found in
   Christendom; and the superiority enjoyed by some over the others, would
   be found to bear an exact proportion to the practical influence of pure
   Christianity.

   On the contrary, if we take a survey of the rich and salubrious
   regions, possessed by Mohammedans, we behold a wide spread desolation.
   The fairest portion of the globe, where arts, literature, and
   refinement, formerly most flourished, are now blighted. Every noble
   institution has sunk into oblivion. Despotism extends its iron sceptre
   over these ill-fated countries, and all the tranquillity ever enjoyed,
   is the dead calm of ignorance and slavery. Useful learning is
   discouraged; free inquiry proscribed, and servile submission required
   of all. Justice is perverted, or disregarded. No man has any security
   for life or property; and as to liberty, it is utterly lost, wherever
   the Mohammedan religion prevails. While the fanatic ardor of making
   proselytes continued, the fury of the propagators of this faith
   rendered them irresistible. Indeed, their whole system is adapted to a
   state of war. The best work that can be performed, according to the
   Koran, is to fight for the propagation of the faith; and the highest
   rewards are promised to those who die in battle. There is no doubt, but
   that the principles of the Koran greatly contributed to the conquests
   of the Saracens; by divesting them of all fear of death, and inspiring
   them with an assurance of being admitted into a sensual paradise, if it
   should be their fate to be slain in battle. "The sword," said he, "is
   the key of heaven and hell: a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a
   night spent under arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting and
   prayer. Whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven. At the day of
   judgment, his wounds shall be resplendent as vermillion, and
   odoriferous as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be replaced by the
   wings of angels and cherubim." But when they had finished their
   conquests, and a state of peace succeeded their long and bloody wars,
   they sunk into torpid indolence and stupidity. While other nations have
   been making rapid improvements in all the arts, they have remained
   stationary; or rather have been continually going backward. They have
   derived no advantages from the revival of letters, the invention of
   printing, or the improvement in the arts and sciences. The people who
   have been subjected to their despotism, without adopting their
   religion, are kept in the most degrading subjection.

   At present, [35] the Greeks are making noble exertions to break the
   cruel yoke, which has oppressed them, and though unsupported by
   Christian nations, have succeeded in expelling the Turks from a large
   portion of their country. God grant them success, and give them wisdom
   to make a good use of their liberty and independence, when acquired and
   established! [36] Mohammedanism was permitted to prevail, as a just
   punishment to Christians, for their luxury and dissensions. It is to be
   hoped, however, that the prescribed time of these locusts of the abyss,
   [37] is nearly come to an end; and that a just God, who has so long
   used them as a scourge to Christians, as he formerly did the Canaanites
   to be thorns in the eyes and in the skies of the Israelites, will soon
   bring to an end this horrible despotism, which has been founded on a
   vile imposture. The signs of the times give strong indications, that
   the Mohammedan power will shortly be subverted. But it is not for us
   "to know the times and the seasons, which the Father hath put in his
   own power."

   The only thing further, necessary to be considered, in this chapter,
   is, the miracles which have been brought forward as a counterpoise to
   the miracles of Christ and his apostles. This is an old stratagem--at.
   least as early as the second century, when one, Philostratus, at the
   request of Julia Augusta, wife of the emperor Severus, wrote a history,
   or rather romance, of Apollonius of Tyana, a town in Capadocia. This
   Apollonius, was nearly contemporary with Jesus Christ; but whether he
   was a philosopher, or a conjurer, cannot now be ascertained; for as to
   the story of Philostratus, which is still extant, it is totally
   unsupported by any reference to eye-witnesses of the facts, or any
   documents of credit, and has, throughout, as much the air of
   extravagant fiction, as any thing that was ever published. That the
   design of the writer was to set up this Apollonius as a rival to Jesus
   Christ, is not avowed, but is sufficiently evident from the similarity
   of many of the miracles ascribed to him, to facts recorded in the
   Gospels, and which are manifestly borrowed from the evangelical
   history. He is made to raise the dead, to cast out demons, and to rise
   from the dead, himself. In one instance, the very words of the demons
   expelled by Jesus Christ, as recorded by St. Luke, "Art thou come to
   torment us before the time," are put into the mouth of a demon, said to
   be cast out by Apollonius. But in addition to these miracles, his
   biographer pretends, that he saw beasts with a human head and lion's
   body;--women half white and half black;--together with phoenixes,
   griffins, dragons, and similar fabulous monsters.

   In the fourth century, Hierocles, a bitter enemy of Christianity,
   instituted a comparison between Jesus and Apollonius, in which, after
   considering their miracles, he gives the preference to the latter. This
   book was answered by Eusebius, from whose work only, we can now learn
   how Hierocles treated the subject, as the book of the latter is not
   extant. The only conclusion which can be deduced from this history of
   Apollonius, is, that the miracles of Christ were so firmly believed, in
   the second century, and were attended by such testimony, that, the
   enemies of Christianity could not deny the facts, and therefore
   resorted to the expedient of circulating stories of equal miracles
   performed by another.

   Modern infidels have not been ashamed to resort to the same stale
   device. Mr. Hume has taken much pains to bring forward a great array of
   evidence, in favor of certain miracles, in which he has no faith, with
   the view of discrediting the truth of Christianity. These have been so
   fully and satisfactorily considered by Dr. Douglass, Bishop of
   Salisbury, in his Criterion; and Dr. Campbell, in his Essay on
   Miracles, that I need only refer to these learned authors, for a
   complete confutation of Hume's arguments, from this source.

   For the sake, however, of those who may not have access to these works,
   I will lay down a few general principles, by which we may distinguish
   between true and false miracles; for which I am indebted, principally,
   to the author of the Criterion, above mentioned.

   1. The nature of the facts should be well considered, whether they are
   miraculous. The testimony which supports a fact may be sufficient, and
   yet it may have been brought about by natural causes.

   The miracles of Jesus Christ were such, that there was no room for
   doubt respecting their supernatural character; but a great part of
   those performed by others, which have received the best attestation,
   were of such a nature, that they may readily be accounted for, without
   supposing any divine interposition. The case of the man diseased in his
   eyes, said to have been cured by Vespasian's rubbing his hand over
   them, and the lame man cured by a touch of the emperor's foot, were, no
   doubt, impositions practised by the priests of the temple, where they
   were performed. The emperor did not pretend to possess any miraculous
   power, and was induced, only after much persuasion, to make the
   experiment. The facts, as related by Tacitus, though he was not an
   eye-witness--it may be admitted--are true. Such persons were probably
   brought forward, and a cure pretended to be made, but there is no
   evidence that there was a real miracle. There was no one present who
   felt interested, to examine into the truth of the miracle. The priests,
   who proposed the thing, had, no doubt, prepared their subjects; and the
   emperor was flattered by the honor of being selected by their god, to
   work a miracle. How often do beggars in the street impose upon many, by
   pretending to be blind and lame? The high encomiums which Mr. Flume
   bestows on the historian Tacitus, in order to set off the testimony to
   the best advantage, can have. no weight here; for he only related what
   he bad heard from others, and showed pretty evidently, that. he did not
   credit the story himself.

   The same may be said, respecting the man spoken of by Cardinal de Retz,
   at Saragossa, who was represented as having been seen without a leg,
   but obtained one by rubbing the stump with holy oil. The cardinal had
   no other evidence of his having ever been maimed, than the suspicious
   report of the canons of the Church; and he took no pains to ascertain,
   whether the leg which he obtained, was really flesh and blood, or an
   artificial limb.

   A great part of the cures said to have been performed at the tomb of
   the Abbé Paris, were proved, upon examination, to be mere pretences;
   and those, which were real, may easily be accounted for, from the
   influence of a heated imagination, and enthusiastic feelings;
   especially, since we have seen the wonderful effects of animal
   magnetism, and metallic tractors. [38]

   2. A second consideration of great weight, is, that in true miracles,
   we can trace the testimony to the very time time when the facts are
   said to have occurred, but in false miracles, the report of the facts
   originates a long time afterwards, as in the case of Apollonius. And in
   the case of the miracles ascribed to Mohammed by Abulfeda and
   Al-Janabbi; and, also, of the miracles ascribed by the Jesuits, to
   Ignatius Loyola, their founder; which were never heard of, until long
   after his death.

   3. Another criterion of importance, is, that the report of miracles
   should originate, and first obtain credit, in the place, and among the
   people, where they are said to have been performed. This is too
   remarkably the fact, in regard to the miracles of the Bible, to require
   any proof. But many stories of miracles are rendered suspicious by the
   circumstance that they were first reported and believed, in some place,
   far from that in which they were alleged to have been wrought. The
   miracles ascribed by the Romanists to Francis Xavier, are condemned by
   both the rules last mentioned. In all his letters, while a missionary
   in the east, he never hints that miracles had been wrought; and a
   reputable writer, who gave some account of his labors, nearly forty
   years after his death, not only is silent about Xavier's miracles, but
   confesses, that no miracles had been performed among the Indians. These
   miracles were said to be performed in the remote parts of India, and
   Japan, but the report of them was published first, in Europe. Almost
   all the miracles ascribed by the Romish Church, to her saints, fall
   into the same predicament. The history of them was written long after
   they are said to have been performed, and often in countries remote
   from the place where it is pretended they occurred.

   4. Another thing necessary to be taken into view, in judging of the
   genuineness of miracles, is, whether the facts were .scrutinized at the
   time, or were suffered to pass without examination. When the miracles
   reported, coincide with the passions and prejudices of those before
   whom they are performed;--when they are exhibited by persons in power,
   who can prevent all examination, and put what face they please on
   facts, they may well be reckoned suspicious. Now, the cures at the tomb
   of the Abbé Paris, were not performed in these circumstances. The
   Jansenists were not in power, and their enemies not only had the
   opportunity to examine into the facts, but actually did so, with the
   utmost diligence. We have reason to believe, therefore, that we have
   now a true report of those occurrences. The defect of these miracles
   is, in their nature, not in their evidence.

   But in most cases, the miracles which have been reported, took place,
   when there was no opportunity of examining into the facts--when the
   people were pleased to be confirmed in their favorite opinions--or,
   when the ruling powers had some particular end to answer. [39]

   But, supposing these miracles to be ever so well attested, I do not
   perceive how the evidence of divine revelation can be affected by them;
   for, if it could be made to appear, that these were supported by
   testimony, as strong as that which can be adduced in favor of the
   miracles of the New Testament, the only fair conclusion is, that, in
   consistency, they who believe in Christianity, should admit them to be
   true--but what then? Would it follow, because miracles had been wrought
   on some rare occasions, different from those recorded in the Bible,
   that, therefore, these were of no validity, as evidence of divine
   revelation? Would not the fact, that other miracles had been wrought,
   rather confirm our belief in those which were performed with so
   important a design? Mr. Hume does, indeed, artfully insinuate, that the
   various accounts of miracles which exist, cannot be true, because the
   religions which they were wrought to confirm, are opposite; yet not one
   of those which he brings forward, as being best attested, was performed
   in confirmation of any new religion, or to prove any particular
   doctrine, therefore they are not opposed to Christianity. If they had
   actually occurred, it would not in the least disparage the evidence for
   the facts recorded in the New Testament. And, especially, it is a
   strange conceit, that miracles performed within the bosom of the
   Christian Church, should furnish any proof against Christianity.

   It is, however, no part of the object of those who bring forward such
   an array of testimony, in support of certain miracles, to prove that
   such facts ever occurred. This is diametrically opposite to their
   purpose. Their design is, to discredit all testimony in favor of
   miracles, by showing, that facts acknowledged to be false, have
   evidence as strong as those ou which revealed religion rests. But they
   have utterly failed in the attempt, as we have shown; and if they had
   succeeded in adducing as strong testimony for other miracles, then we
   would readily admit their truth, and that, in perfect consistency with
   our belief in Christianity.

CHAPTER X.

   THE BIBLE CONTAINS INTERNAL EVIDENCE THAT ITS ORIGIN IS DIVINE.

   As the Old and New Testaments are intimately connected, and form parts
   of the same system, it is unnecessary to make any distinction between
   them, in considering this branch of the evidence of divine revelation.

   A late writer, [40] of great eminence and popularity, has represented
   this species of evidence as unsatisfactory; as not capable of being so
   treated, as to produce conviction in the minds of philosophical
   infidels; and as opening a door to their most specious objections to
   Christianity. But, certainly, this is not the most effectual method of
   supporting the credit of the Scriptures. Another popular writer [41]
   has gone to the other extreme; and seems to set little value on the
   external evidences of Christianity, while be exhibits the internal, in
   a light so strong, that his argument assumes the appearance of
   demonstration.

   But these two species of evidence, though distinct, are harmonious, and
   strengthen each other. There is, therefore, no propriety in disparaging
   the one, for the purpose of enhancing the value of the other. I
   believe, the fact is, however, that more instances have occurred of
   skeptical men being convinced of the truth of Christianity, by the
   internal, than the external evidences. It is the misfortune of most
   infidels, that they have no intimate acquaintance with the Bible; and
   even many of those who have undertaken to write against it, appear
   never to have read it, with any other view, than to find some ground of
   objection.

   No doubt, it is necessary to come to the examination of this species of
   evidence, with a candid and docile disposition. If reason be permitted
   proudly to assume the seat of judgment, and to undertake to decide what
   a revelation ought to contain in particular; in what manner, and with
   what degree of light it should be communicated; whether it should be
   made perfectly at once, or gradually unfolded; and whether, from the
   beginning, it should be universal: no doubt, the result of an
   examination of the contents of the Bible, conducted on such principles,
   will prove unsatisfactory; and insuperable objections will occur .at
   every step in the progress. It was wise in Dr. Chalmers, to endeavor to
   discourage such a mode of investigation, as being most unreasonable;
   for how is it possible, that such a creature as man, should be able to
   know what is proper for the infinite God to do, or in what way he
   should deal with his creatures upon earth? To borrow the language of
   this powerful writer; [42] "We have experience of man, but we have no
   experience of God. We can reason Upon the procedure of man in given
   circumstances, because this is an accessible subject, and comes under
   the cognizance of observation; but we cannot reason on the procedure of
   the Almighty in given circumstances." But when he speaks "of
   disclaiming all support from what is commonly understood by the
   internal evidence," and "saving a vast deal of controversy, by proving
   that all this is superfluous and uncalled for," I am constrained to
   think, that, instead of aiding the cause of Christianity, the excellent
   author has attempted to take away one of its firmest props. The
   internal evidence of revelation is analogous to the evidence of the
   being and perfections of God, from the works of creation: and the same
   mode of reasoning winch the deist adopts, relative to the doctrines and
   institutions of the Bible, the atheist may adopt, with equal force,
   against the existence of a God. If men will be so presumptuous as to
   determine, that if God makes a world, he will form it according to
   their idea of fitness, and that the apparent imperfections and
   incomprehensibilities in the material universe, could never have
   proceeded from a Being of infinite perfection, atheism must follow of
   course. But, if, notwithstanding all these apparent evils and
   obscurities, there is in the structure of the world, the most
   convincing evidence of the existence of an all-wise and all-powerful
   Being; why may we not expect to find the same kind of evidence,
   impressed on a revelation from God? Upon Dr. Chalmers' principles, we
   ought to depend simply on historical testimony, for the fact, that God
   created this world; and "disclaim all support" from what. may, without,
   impropriety, be termed the internal evidence of the existence of God,
   derived from the contemplation of the work itself. The truth, however,
   is, that every thing which proceeds from God, whatever difficulties or
   obscurities accompany it, will contain and exhibit the impress of his
   character. As this is resplendently visible in the heavens and the
   earth, it is reasonable to. think that it will not be less manifest in
   his word. If the truths contained in a revelation be worthy of God,
   they will be stamped with his image; and if this can be, in any
   measure, discovered, undoubtedy it furnishes the most direct and
   convincing evidence of their divine origin. In fact this is, without
   being reduced to the form of a regular argument, precisely the evidence
   on which the faith of the great body of Christians has always rested.
   They are incapable of appreciating the force of the external evidence.
   It requires an extent, of learning, which plain laboring Christians,
   cannot be supposed commonly to posse.. But the internal evidence is
   within their reach: it acts directly upon their minds, whenever they
   read or hear a portion of the word of God. The belief of common,
   unlearned Christians, is not necessarily founded in the mere prejudice
   of education: it rests on the best possible evidence. And as there is a
   faith which is saving, and to which a purifying efficacy is ascribed;
   if we inquire, on what species of evidence this depends, it must be
   answered, on internal evidence: not, indeed, as perceived by the
   unaided intellect of man, but as it is. exhibited to the mind, by the
   illumination of the Holy Spirit. We cannot consent, therefore, to give
   up this species of evidence, as "superfluous and uncalled for," but
   must consider it, if not the most effectual to silence gainsayers, yet
   certainly the most useful to the real Christian; and if unbelievers
   could be induced to attend to it, with docility and impartiality, there
   is reason to think, that they would experience its efficacy, in the
   gradual production of a firm conviction of the truth of Christianity.
   The internal evidence of the truth of the Scriptures, cannot be fully
   brought into view, in any other way, than by a careful study of the
   Bible. It cannot easily be put into the form, of logical argument, for
   it consists in moral fitness and beauty: in the adaptation of truth to
   the constitution of the human mind; in its astonishing power of
   penetrating and searching the heart, and affecting the conscience.
   There is a sublime sanctity in the doctrines and precepts of the
   Gospel; a devotional and heavenly spirit pervading the Scriptures; a
   purity and holy tendency, which cannot but be felt by the serious
   reader of the word of God; and a power to soothe and comfort the
   sorrowful mind: all which qualities may be perceived, and will have
   their effect, but cannot be embodied and presented, with their full
   force, in the form of argument. But, although this evidence, from the
   nature of the case, cannot be exhibited in its entire body, to any but
   those who study the Scriptures, and meditate on their truths, day and
   night, yet it is possible to select some prominent points, and present
   them to the reader, in such a light., as to produce a salutary
   impression. This is what will now be briefly attempted, in the
   following remarks, which might, without difficulty, be greatly
   enlarged:

   1. The Scriptures speak of God and his attributes; in a way which
   accords with what right reason would lead us to expect, in a divine
   revelation. He is uniformly represented in the Bible, as ONE, and as a
   Being of infinite perfection; as
   eternal,--omnipotent,--omniscient,--omnipresent--and immutable. And it
   is truly remarkable, that these correct and sublime views of theology
   were entertained by those who possessed the Scriptures, when all other
   nations had fallen into the grossest polytheism, and most degrading
   idolatry. Other nations were more powerful, and greatly excelled the
   Israelites in human learning; but in the knowledge of God, all were in
   thick darkness, whilst this people enjoyed the light of truth. Learned
   men and philosophers arose in different countries, and obtained
   celebrity on account of their theories, but they effected no change in
   the popular opinions; indeed, they could not enlighten others, when
   they were destitute of the light of truth, themselves. However deists
   may deride and scoff at the Bible, it is a fact capable of the clearest
   proof, that had it not been for the Scriptures, there would, not, at
   this time, be such a thing as pure theist upon earth. There is not now
   in the world, an individual who believes in one infinitely perfect God,
   whose knowledge of this truth may not be traced, directly or
   indirectly, to the Bible.

   How can it be accounted for, that the true theology should be found
   accompanying the Scriptures, in ages, while it was last, every where
   else, unless we admit that they are a revelation from God? If the
   knowledge of the true God, as received by the Jews, was the discovery
   of reason, why was it that other nations, advanced far beyond them in
   learning and mental culture, never arrived at the knowledge of his
   important truth?

   It is true, indeed, that the Scriptures sometimes represent God as
   having bodily parts, and human passions; but a little consideration
   will show the attentive reader that all these expressions are used in
   accommodation to the manner of speaking among men. The truth is, that
   all human language is inadequate to express the attributes and
   operations of the Supreme Being. He is infinitely above our
   conceptions,. both in his essence; and mode of existence and acting. We
   can do no more than approximate towards just ideas, on this subject.
   When we speak of Him, we are under the necessity of conceiving of his
   perfections, with some relation to the operations of the human mind,
   and to employ language expressive of human acts, and feelings: for all
   other language would be unintelligible. The necessity of this
   accomodation extends much thriller than many seem to suppose: it exists
   not only in relation to words, which taken literally, convey the idea
   of bodily members and human passions, but also in regard to those which
   express the operations of will and intellect. This mode of speaking,
   therefore, instead of-being an objection against the Bible, is an
   argument of the wisdom of its Author, who has spoken to man in the only
   way in which he could be understood.

   Again, it is seen by the most cursory reader, that truth is not taught
   in the Bible, in a scientific, or-systematic order. We have here no
   profound metaphysical disquisitions; no discussion of philosophical
   principles; no array of artificial dialectics; and no systematic
   arrangement of the subjects treated. In all this, there may be great
   wisdom, and whether we. can see the reason or not, the objection to
   revelation, on this ground, is not greater than the one which may be
   made to the natural world, because the materials for building, which it
   contains, are not found erected into houses; and because all its fields
   and forests, are not placed in the order of an artificial garden, or
   regular orchard.

   The method of speaking of God, in the Sacred Scriptures, is at once
   most simple, and sublime. Few words are employed, but these are most
   significant., When Moses wished to receive an appropriate name, which
   he might mention to Pharaoh, to whom he was sent, he was directed to
   say, I am that I am hath sent me. And when, on another occasion, the
   name of the Most High was declared to Moses, it was in the following
   remarkable words, THE LORD, THE LORD GOD, MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS, LONG
   SUFFERING AND ABUNDANT IN GOODNESS AND TRUTH. KEEPING MERCY FOR
   THOUSANDS; FORGIVING INIQUITY, AND TRANSGRESSION AND SIN; AND THAT WILL
   BY NO MEANS CLEAR THE GUILTY. If the most perfect simplicity, united
   with the highest sublimity, would be received as a proof; that the
   writers of these books were inspired, we could adduce hundreds of
   passages of this description; but we mean not to lay any undue stress
   on the argument derived from this source.

   The glory of the Scriptures is, the revelation which they contain of
   the moral attributes of God. These are manifested with but a feeble
   light, in the works of creation; but, in the Bible they shine with
   transcendent lustre. It would, by no means comport with the intended
   brevity of this work, to enter much into detail on this subject, but I
   must beg the indulgence of the reader, while I endeavor to bring
   distinctly into view, the account which the Scriptures give us, of the
   HOLINESS, and the GOODNESS of GOD.

   These two attributes are stamped on the pages of the Bible, and form
   its grand characteristic. It is of no importance, whether we consider
   these as distinct, or as expressive of two aspects, in which the same
   infinite excellence is exhibited. Who can open this sacred book,
   without perceiving that the God of the Bible was Holy? All his laws,
   institutions, and dispensations, are holy; even those laws which are
   ceremonial, have this characteristic. Every person, edifice, and
   utensil, employed in his worship, must be solemnly consecrated; and all
   must approach God with caution and reverence, because he is Holy. The
   very ground where he occasionally makes himself known, is rendered
   holy. Every external sign and emblem of profound reverence, is required
   in them, who worship Him; and when he manifests himself with more than
   usual clearness, the holiest men are overwhelmed, and become as dead
   men, under a sense of their own vileness. And not only so, but even the
   heavenly hosts, who are free from every stain of sin, seem to be
   overwhelmed with the view of the HOLINESS of God: They not only cry to
   one another, as they worship around his august throne, HOLY, HOLY,
   HOLY, but they are represented, as falling prostrate at his feet, and
   veiling their faces, in token of profound veneration. All those
   passages of Scripture, which speak of the WRATH, the INDIGNATION, the
   FURY, the JEALOUSY, or the ANGER of the Almighty, are no more than
   strong expressions of his infinite holiness. All his severe judgments
   and threatenings; all the misery which he ever inflicts on his
   creatures, in this world, or the next; and above all, the intense and
   ineffable sufferings of Christ, are exhibitions of the holiness of God.

   Now, if there be a God, he must be holy; and if he make a revelation of
   himself, it will be marked with. this impress of character. But. wicked
   men would, never have made this attribute so prominent; they would
   rather have been disposed to keep it entirely out of view. There is no
   truth more evident to the attentive observer of human nature, than that
   men do not naturally love holiness, although they are obliged to
   acknowledge its worth. This, I believe, is the true reason, why the
   Scriptures, although they contain the highest excellence in
   composition, both in prose and poetry, of which a good taste cannot be
   insensible, are neglected by literary men; or rather studiously
   avoided. A mere fragment of any other book, if it could claim pp equal
   antiquity with. the Bible; and, especially, if it contained any thing
   like as much excellence of composition, would be sought after with
   avidity, by all men of taste; but the Bible remains almost as much
   unstudied by men of this description, as the Koran. This has often
   appeared to me paradoxical; but I am now persuaded, that the true
   reason is, the awful holiness of God, as exhibited in this book, and
   impressed on almost every page. This glares upon the conscience of an
   unholy man, as the meridian sun on diseased eyes. God is a consuming
   fire. But this common dislike of the Bible, even in men of refined
   taste and decent lives, furnishes a strong argument for its divine
   origin. The question before us, is, who composed this book--inspired
   men, or wicked impostors? The characteristic, which we have been
   considering, will accord perfectly with the former supposition, but
   never can be reconciled with the latter. There is a moral certainty,
   that base impostors never would have written a book, the most
   remarkable trait of which is HOLINESS.

   The goodness of God, or that benevolence which he exercises towards his
   creatures, as it appears in the providence which sustains and feeds so
   great a multitude of creatures, and which is conspicuously manifested
   to the human family, is often celebrated in the Scriptures. Some of the
   most beautiful and sublime poems which were ever written, are employed
   in celebrating the praise of God, for his marvellous goodness. The
   reader is requested to turn to the xxxiv, the ciii, civ, cxlv, cxlvi,
   cxlvii, and cxlviii, Psalms, as an exemplification of this remark.

   But there is another, and a peculiar view of the divine goodness, given
   in the Scriptures. It is that form of goodness, called MERCY. It is the
   love of creatures, who had forfeited all claim to any kindness. It is
   the bestowing of pardon and salvation on those, who are condemned to
   death by the righteous laws of God; and this, without showing himself
   less displeased with their sins, than if he had punished them forever.
   This is the view of divine goodness, which is peculiar to the Bible.
   Reason could not have formed a conjecture concerning it. It is the
   development of a trait in the divine character, before unknown. To
   reveal the mercy of God, may, with truth, be said, to be the principal
   object of the Bible. But our idea of this divine goodness is very
   imperfect, until we learn, in what way it was manifested. No words can
   express this so well, as those of Christ himself, "God so loved the
   world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on
   him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

   To many, perhaps, it will appear, that this love is so extraordinary,
   that it rather forms an objection against the Bible, than an argument
   in its favor. If the wonderful and unparalleled nature of any thing
   were an objection to it, then I acknowledge, that there would be some
   ground for this opinion. But what is there which is not full of
   wonders, when we come to contemplate it attentively? It is wonderful
   that there should exist such a creature as man, or such a body of light
   as the sun; but shall we, therefore; refuse to believe in their
   existence? To conic nearer to the subject, what is there in the
   character of God, or his works, which is not calculated to fill the
   mind with surpassing wonder! His eternity--His omniscience--His
   omnipresence--His creating power, and universal providence, are so
   wonderful, that we are at a loss to say which is most wonderful; or
   whether any thing else can be more wonderful. But is this any argument
   against their reality? And if God is so wonderful in his other
   attributes, shall we expect to find nothing of this kind, in his LOVE,
   which is his highest glory? There is, indeed, no goodness of this sort
   among men; but shall we make our faint and limited shadow of
   perfection, the measure by which to judge of the character of the
   infinite God? How unreasonable such a procedure! The objection derived
   from the insignificance of man, the object of this wonderful love, is
   delusive; for the same objection would lie, if his powers were
   increased ever so much. in comparison with God, all creatures may be
   considered as on a level; in this view, all distinctions among them
   are, as it were, annihilated. How easy would it be to construct an
   argument against the providence of God, on the same principles! There
   are innumerable myriads of animalcules, invisible to man, all of which
   have a perfect organization, and no more than an ephemeral existence,
   It might be said, these minute creatures are too diminutive, to occupy
   the attention of an infinite Being. It might be said, that the display
   of so much skill in the organization of creatures of a day, was
   unsuitable to the wisdom of God. But however plausible such objections
   may be made to appear, they are all founded in a presumptuous intrusion
   into what does not appertain to us, and concerning which we have no
   ability to form any correct judgment. The truth is, that man has an
   infinitude below him, as well as above him, in the gradation of being.
   I do not mean to say, that creation is absolutely infinite, but that we
   can fix no bounds to the possibility of a continual existence of
   creatures in the scale of perpetual diminution, any more than we can to
   the possibility of creatures still increasing in magnitude above us. In
   this respect, as in others, we stand between two infinitudes, the great
   and the small, if I may so speak. A single drop of liquid contains
   myriads of perfectly organized creatures; and who knows but every
   particle of the blood of these invisible animalcules may contain other
   worlds of beings still more minute, without it being possible for us to
   fix any limit to the diminution in the size of creatures.

   But, to return; unless it can be shown, that such love, as that
   exhibited in the Gospel, is impossible, which will not be pretended, or
   that it is repugnant to the moral attributes of God, its wonderful
   nature can never be properly used as an argument against its existence.
   Rather, it should be argued, the more wonderful, the more like God; the
   more wonderful, if no appearance of human weakness accompany it, the
   more unlikely to be the invention of man.

   And, here, I would mention an idea, which, if correct, will shed light
   on the subject; namely, that wonder is congenial to the constitution of
   our minds. The soul of man never enjoys more elevated emotions, and
   more exalted pleasure, than in the contemplation of objects so great
   and vast, as to he perfectly incomprehensible. This is the foundation
   of that perpetual adoration which occupies the inhabitants of heaven.
   An incomprehensible God, is the object of contemplation and wonder to
   every creature.

   2. The account which the Bible gives of the origin and character of
   man, accords, very exactly, with reason and experience.

   Indeed, this is the only source of our knowledge respecting the
   circumstances in which man was placed, when he came from the hand of
   his Creator. Here we learn the origin of many things which we observe,
   but the reason of which we never could have discovered. The Bible
   teaches us, that the wickedness which has existed in all ages and among
   all people, originated in the apostacy of the first pair. It tells us
   the reason of covering the body with clothing, which is the custom of
   all nations, even where clothing is unnecessary to preserve the body
   from the effects of cold. Here, we learn the cause of the earth's
   producing briers and thorns spontaneously, while useful grain and
   fruits must be cultivated. Here, we learn the origin of marriage, and,
   of the curse which has followed the female sex, through all ages. Moses
   has also given us the origin of that species of religious worship,
   which was anciently practised among all people, but of which, reason
   can teach us nothing. I mean the sacrifice of animals on an altar, and
   the offerings of grain, of incense, &c. He has also related the fact of
   a universal deluge, of which we have so many ocular proofs, in every
   country, and on every mountain, as well as so many ancient traditions.

   The dispersion of the human family over the face of the earth, and the
   origin of the several nations of antiquity, are recorded in the Bible:
   and, although, this record is contained in a single short chapter, and
   has to us much obscurity, yet Bishop Watson declared, that if he had no
   other evidence of the authenticity of the Pentateuch, besides the tenth
   chapter of Genesis, he would deem that alone satisfactory. [43]

   The origin of the diversity of language, is also found in the Bible,
   and not learned from any other source. Indeed, the origin of language
   itself, concerning which philosophers have disputed so much, is very
   evident., from the history of Moses. Many learned men have thought,
   that alphabetical writing took its rise from the writing of the
   decalogue, by the finger of God, upon the tables of stone; and I
   believe, that it would be found very difficult to prove, by any
   authentic documents, that this art existed before. Be this as it may,
   it must be admitted, that the earliest specimen of alphabetical writing
   now extant, is contained in the Bible.

   To these particulars it may be added, that we have an account in the
   Bible, of those nations and people, concerning whom the earliest
   profane historians treat, long before their histories commence; and
   when history comes down to that period when the affairs of nations are
   described by others, it receives ample corroboration from their
   narratives, as well as gives great light, to enable us to understand
   many things which they have imperfectly recorded.

   But the account which the Bible gives of the moral condition of man, is
   that which is now most to our purpose. In all ages and circumstances,
   the human race are represented as exceedingly depraved and wicked.
   Every man is declared to be a transgressor, and the root of this
   depravity is placed in the heart. Many of the gross crimes, to which we
   all are inclined, and into the practice of which many fall, are
   enumerated; and where these are avoided and concealed, the heart is
   described as deceitful and desperately wicked; and that pride and
   hypocrisy, which spread a false covering over the true character of
   man, are denounced, as among the things most hateful to God. Now, if
   this picture is not taken from the life; if the character of man is
   entirely different from that delineated in the Scriptures; or, if the
   vices of our nature are exaggerated; however difficult it may be to
   account for such misrepresentation, still it would furnish a strong
   argument against the inspiration of the writers of the several books of
   which the Bible consists. But on the other hand, if the character of
   man, as- given in the Scriptures, is found exactly to correspond with
   universal experience and observation, it will be an incontestable
   proof, that the writers were guided by a strict regard to truth, in
   their compositions. To enter into a particular consideration of this
   subject, does not comport with the plan of this work; but for the truth
   of the representations of Scripture, I would appeal to all authentic
   history, and to every man's own observation and experience. The
   description which the apostle Paul gives of the vices of the heathen
   world, in his time, is corroborated by all the historians and satirists
   who lived near that period. And who needs a labored proof, to show,
   that men have generally a tendency to be wicked? Every civil
   institution, and all the mist expensive provisions of civil government,
   are intended to set up barriers against the violence, injustice, and
   licentiousness of man. Indeed, civil government itself, originated in
   nothing else, than the necessity of protection against the wickedness
   of men. This, however, is a painful and mortifying conclusion; and it
   is not wonderful, that pride and self-flattery should render us
   reluctant to admit it; nevertheless, every impartial man must
   acknowledge, that our character is correctly drawn in the Bible.

   There is something wonderful in the power, which the word of God
   possesses over the consciences of men. To those who never read or hear
   it, this fact must be unknown; but it is manifest to those who are
   conversant with the sacred volume, or who are in the habit of hearing
   it expounded. Why should this book, above all others, have the power of
   penetrating, and, as it were, searching, the inmost recesses of the
   soul, and shewing to a man, the multitude and enormity of the evils of
   his heart and life? This may, by some, be attributed to early
   education, but I believe, that if the experiment could be fairly tied,
   it would be found, that men who had never been brought up with any
   sentiments of reverence for the Bible, would experience its power over
   the conscience. The very best cure, therefore, for infidelity, would
   be, the serious perusal of the Holy Scriptures. "The entrance of thy
   word giveth light. The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the
   soul."

   3. It deserves our special attention, in considering the internal
   evidences of Christianity, that the Scriptures contain explicit
   information on those points, on which man stands most in need of
   instruction. These may be reduced to three: first., the doctrine of a
   future state of retribution; secondly, the assurance that sin may be
   pardoned, and the method by which this can consistently be done; and,
   thirdly, the means for restoring. the depraved nature of man, to a
   state of rectitude. We are not capable of determining, in particular,
   as we have before shown, what a revelation should contain, but it is
   reasonable to think, that if God gives a revelation, it will contain
   some instruction on these important points.

   And when we examine what the Scriptures teach, on these subjects, it is
   found, that the doctrine is worthy of God, and so adapted to the
   necessities of man, that it affords a strong argument in favor of their
   inspiration.

   The certainty of a future existence to man, is a prominent feature in
   the New Testament. The connexion between our present conduct and future
   condition, is clearly and expressly inculcated. Many interesting and
   momentous truths, connected with the world to come, are presented in a
   light, the best calculated to make a deep and salutary impression on
   the mind. It is revealed, that there will be a general judgment of all
   then and that God hath appointed a day when this event shall take
   place. It is, moreover, taught, in the New-Testament, that not only
   will every man be judged, but every action of every individual, whether
   it be good or bad, will be brought under review; and that the eternal
   destiny of all men will be fixed, agreeably to the judicial decision of
   this impartial trial. Some will be admitted to everlasting life, in the
   world above, while others shall go away into. everlasting misery, into
   that place, "prepared for the devil and his angels."

   Another interesting fact revealed in the New Testament, is, that there
   will be a general resurrection of the bodies of all men, previously to
   the final judgment. This fact, reason could never have conjectured: it
   must, from its nature, be a matter of pure revelation. We may, indeed,
   discover some remote analogy to the resurrection, in the apparent death
   and resuscitation of vegetables and some animals, but this could never
   have authorized, the conclusion that the bodies of men, after being
   mingled with the dust of the earth, would be reorganized and
   re-animated, by the same souls which were connected with them before
   their death. This doctrine, however, is very interesting; and to the
   pious, must be very pleasing and animating, as we may learn from the
   beautiful and striking description of the resurrection, given by Paul,
   "It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in
   weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is
   raised a spiritual body;--For this corruptible must put on
   incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."

   It is worthy of remark, that although the Scriptures express the joys
   of heaven, and the miseries of hell, by the strongest figures, they do
   not enter much into detail, respecting the condition of men, in the
   future world. There is true wisdom in this silence; because it is a
   subject, of which we are, at present, incapable. of forming any
   distinct conceptions. Paul, after being caught up "to paradise, and to
   the third heaven," gave no account of what he saw and heard, when he
   returned. How different is this from the ridiculous description of the
   seven heavens, by Mohammed; and from the reveries of Emmanuel
   Swedenborg! The account of a future state, contained in the New
   Testament, is just that which is best suited to our present imperfect
   mode of conceiving; and at the same time, adapted to make the deepest
   impressions on the minds of men.

   The method of obtaining the pardon of sin, which is made known in the
   Scriptures, is so extraordinary, and yet so perfectly calculated to
   reconcile the forgiveness of the sinner, with the justice and holiness
   of God, that it seems very improbable, that it is a mere human device.
   The mission from heaven, of a person called the Son of God; his
   miraculous assumption of human nature; his holy and benevolent.
   character; and his laying down his life as an expiation for the sins of
   men, are, indeed wonderful events, but on that account, not likely to
   be the invention of impostors. The death of Christ, may be considered
   the central point in the Christian system. This was so far from being
   an incidental thing, or an event occurring in the common course of
   nature, that it is, every where, represented to be the very purpose of
   Christ's coming into the world. This, according to the Gospel, is the
   grand means of obtaining all blessings for sinners. It is the great
   vicarious sacrifice, offered up to God in behalf of the people, in
   consequence of which God can be just and the justifier of all who
   believe in Jesus. To know Christ crucified, therefore, is to know the
   whole Gospel;--to preach Christ crucified, is to preach the whole
   Gospel;--for all its doctrines are involved in this event. The plan of
   salvation revealed in the Scriptures, is founded on the principle of
   receiving satisfaction for the transgressions of the sinner, from
   another person, who is able to render to the law all that is required
   from the offender This satisfaction was made by the obedience of Christ
   unto death, and is accepted by the Judge of all, in place of a perfect
   obedience of the sinner, in behalf of all those to whom it shall be
   applied. This method of obtaining pardon is honorable to God, because,
   while he receives the transgressor into favor, he expresses his hatred
   of sin in the strongest manner, and requires that the demands of his
   holy law be perfectly fulfilled; and it is suited to man, for it comes
   down to his impotence and wretchedness, and offers him a finished and
   gratuitous salvation, without works or merit of his own. And that there
   may be no room for an abuse of this doctrine of FREE GRACE, it is
   provided, that all who hope for the benefits of this redemption, shall
   yield a sincere obedience to the Gospel; and thus evince their
   penitence for their sins, and their love to the Saviour. Ungodly men
   may pervert this doctrine, and turn the grace. of God into
   licentiousness, but this receives no encouragement from the principles
   of the Gospel: it is merely the effect of the perverseness of sinful
   men.

   This leads me to speak of the third thing, which was mentioned as
   important to be known by man, which is the means by which a depraved
   nature may be restored to rectitude; or in other words, how the
   thorough reformation of a sinner may be effected. On this subject,
   philosophy has never been able to shed any light. And this is not
   wonderful; for the most that human wisdom if ever so perfect could
   effect, would be the direction and regulation of the natural principles
   and passions of men; but in this way no true reformation can be
   produced. Whatever changes are effected, will be only from one species
   of sin to another. In order to a radical restoration of the soul to
   moral rectitude, or to any degree of it, there is a necessity for the
   introduction, into the mind, of some new and powerful principle of
   action, sufficient to counteract or expel the principles of sin. It is
   in vain that men talk of producing a restoration to virtue, by reason:
   the mere perception of the right way will answer no purpose, unless
   there is some inclination to pursue it. Now, the want of virtuous
   affections, or to speak more correctly, of holy dispositions, is the
   great defect of our nature, in which our depravity radically consists;
   and the only way by which man can be led to lore and pursue the course
   of obedience to the law of God, is, by having love to God and to
   holiness excited, or implanted in his soul. But to effect this, is not
   in the power of any creature; it is a work which requires a divine
   energy--a creating power; and therefore a true conversion from the ways
   of sin, was never effected without supernatural aid. There may be an
   external reformation. There may be, and often is, a change of governing
   principles. The man who in his youth was under the predominant
   influence of the love of pleasure, may, in advanced years, fall
   completely under the control of avarice or ambition; but in every such
   case, the change is effected by one active principle becoming so
   strong, as to counteract or suppress another. It may be laid down as a
   universal maxim, that all changes of character are brought about by
   exciting, implanting, or strengthening, active principles, sufficient
   to overcome those which before governed the man.

   Now let us inquire, what plan of reformation is proposed in the
   Scriptures. It is such a one, as precisely accords with the principles
   laid down. The necessity of regeneration, by the power of God, is
   taught almost in every variety of form, both in the Old and New
   Testament. The effect of the divine energy on the soul, is, A NEW
   HEART; or, new principles of moral action, the leading exercises of
   which are love to God, and love to man. Let a philosophical survey be
   taken of the nature of man, with his complete system of perceptions,
   passions, appetites, and affections; and then suppose this powerful and
   holy principle introduced into the soul, and it will be seen, that all
   the faculties and propensities of man, will be reduced to order; and
   the vices of our nature will be eradicated. Pretenders to reason and
   philosophy have often ridiculed this doctrine, as absurd; whereas, it
   is, in every respect, consistent with the soundest philosophy. It is
   the very thing which a wise philosopher, who should undertake to solve
   the problem, how depraved man might be restored to virtue, would
   demand. But like the foundation Archimedes required for his lever to
   raise the the principle necessary for a sinner's reformation, which
   reason and philosophy cannot furnish.

   The Bible is the only book which ever taught the method of purifying
   the soul from sin. A thousand actual devices have been tried by
   philosophers, and es of other systems. One of the most common een, to
   endeavour to extricate the soul from the nce of the body, by various
   methods of mortification, and purgation; but all these plans have
   adopted lse principle, that the body is the chief seat of rity, and
   therefore they have ever proved unsuccessful. The disease lies deeper,
   and is further removed ... the reach of their remedies, than they
   supposed. he Gospel which teaches the true philosophy regarding the
   seat of sin, and its cure. Out of the heart d all evils, according to
   the Bible. And if we make the fruit good, we must first make the od.

   This necessity of divine agency to make men truly us, does not,
   however, supersede the use of means, lude the operation of rational
   motives. When a principle is introduced into a rational soul, in the e
   of this principle, the soul is governed by the general laws of
   understanding and choice, as be The principle of piety is pre-eminently
   a rational le, in its operation. God is loved, because he is viewed to
   be a most excellent and amiable being. n is preferred to earth, because
   it is seen to be a ter and more enduring inheritance; and so of all
   exercises.

   naturally led, from the consideration of this t, to speak of the moral
   system of the New Testament. I confine my remarks here, to the New
   Testament, not because it teaches a different rule of moral duty, from
   the Old, but because it teaches it more clearly.

   I need say nothing in general commendation of the moral precepts of the
   Gospel. They have extorted the highest praise from many of the most
   determined enemies of Christianity. No man has been able to show how
   they could be improved in any one point. It has sometimes, indeed, been
   objected, that this system was not suited to man, because it requires a
   purity and perfection to which he can never attain; but the objection
   concedes the very point which we wish to establish,--namely, the
   absolute perfection of the Gospel system of morality. It surely
   requires no argument to prove, that if God revealed a rule for the
   regulation of his creatures, it will be a perfect rule. It will never
   do to admit, that the law must be lowered in its demands, to adapt it
   to the imperfection of creatures. This would be destructive of all law.

   It has again been objected, that in the precepts of the New Testament,
   many splendid virtues, acknowledged by the heathen moralists, have been
   omitted. Patriotism, friendship, bravery, &c., have been specified as
   be. longing to this class. To which we reply, that so far as patriotism
   and friendship are moral virtues, they are included in the general
   precepts of the Gospel, which require us to love our fellow men, and do
   them good; and in those which command us to think of "Whatsoever things
   are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report;" but when the love of
   country, and the attachment to a friend, interfere with the general
   obligations of loving all men, they are no longer virtues, but vices.

   The excellence of the moral system of the New Testament, will be
   manifest, if we consider,--

   1. Its simple, yet comprehensive character. All moral duties which can
   be conceived, as obligatory on man, are here reduced to two grand
   principles, the love of God, and the love of man. The measure of the
   first is, the full extent of our capacity; of the second, the love
   which we have for ourselves. On these two, says Christ, hang all the
   law and the prophets. The duties which relate to temperance and
   self-government, do not need any additional principle. If the soul be
   filled with love to God, and with love to man, self-love will be so
   regulated and directed, as to answer every purpose in moving us to
   perform what has been called our duty to ourselves.

   2. The precepts of morality, in the New Testament; although sometimes
   expressed in comprehensive language, are often applied to the actual
   relations and various conditions of men. We are not left to infer
   particular duties from general principles, but the duties of
   individuals, according to their circumstances, are distinctly enjoined.
   Parents and children, husbands and wives, magistrates and subjects,
   ministers and people, the rich and the poor, the friend and the
   stranger, have all their respective duties clearly marked out.

   3. Moral duties which have been overlooked, or misunderstood, by other
   teachers, are here prominently exhibited, and solemnly inculcated. The
   virtues of humility, meekness, forbearance, and the forgiveness of
   injuries were not acknowledged by the heathen moralists; but in the New
   Testament they are made to assume their proper place, and much of true
   goodness is made to consist in their exercise. At the time of the
   advent of Christ, many false principles of morality had gained
   currency. The duty of loving all men, had been circumscribed within
   narrow limits. Men charged with heresy, as the Samaritans, or notorious
   sinners, as the Publicans, were, by the Jews, considered as properly
   excluded from all participation in their kindness, or courtesy. The
   duty of subjection to a foreign power, by which they had been
   conquered; and especially, the duty of yielding obedience to a wicked
   tyrannical prince, was one on which it required much wisdom to decide
   aright. The people were divided among themselves on this point; it was
   therefore selected by a combination of both parties, as a fit subject
   to entangle our Lord, by obliging him to decide one way or the other,
   and thus expose himself to the opposition of one of the parties. But
   when they asked him whether it was lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar or
   not, he called for a denarius, and looking at the image stamped upon
   it, asked whose it was; and upon being answered, Cæsar's, made the
   following remarkable reply, "Render unto Cæsar the things that are
   Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's." By which he decided,
   that, inasmuch as they permitted the coin of Cæsar to circulate among
   them, which was an evidence of his sovereignty over them, and availed
   themselves of this money for purposes of trade, there could be no
   impropriety in rendering to Cæsar what properly belongs to him; and,
   also, that this was not incompatible with their allegiance to God. So
   that, virtually, in this answer, he reproved both the Pharisees and the
   Herodians; the former, of whom made their duty to God a pretext for
   refusing to pay tribute to the Emperor; and the latter, to secure the
   favor of the reigning powers, neglected their duty to God.

   Paul, living under the government of Nero, prescribes obedience to the
   existing powers, not from fear of suffering their displeasure, but "for
   conscience sake." This is the general rule of duty, on this difficult
   subject, than which none can be wiser; but it must not be considered,
   as inculcating passive obedience and nonresistance, in all cases. Yet,
   as long as a government has authority, so long we are bound to obey.
   Christianity is so constituted, as not to interfere with any civil
   institution. It takes men as it finds them, in all the relations of
   life, and teaches them their duty. It never can, therefore, be the
   cause of sedition, and opposition to existing governments. It considers
   all civil rulers, as the ministers of God, for the peace and good order
   of society, and for the punishment of those that do evil. It is made
   the duty of Christians, therefore, to be "subject unto the higher
   powers," and "not to resist the ordinance of God.--To render to all
   their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear
   to whom fear; honor to whom honor." [44] --But when they who have the
   right to change the government, of a country, exercise it, and put down
   one set of rulers, and set up another, the principle of Christian duty
   remains the same. And if, in any country, Christians form a majority of
   the nation, there is no reason why they may not exercise this right of
   new modelling their government, or changing their rulers, as well as
   others.

   4. The moral system of the New Testament traces all virtue to the
   heart, and sets no value on the most splendid and costly offerings, or
   the most punctilious discharge of religious duties, when the motives
   are not pure. The first inclination of the mind to an illicit object,
   is denounced to be a violation of the law; and words of reproach, and
   all idle words, are among the sins for which an account must be given
   in the Judgment. Prayers and alms, proceeding from vain glory, are
   represented as receiving no reward from God, however they may be
   applauded by men.

   The love of this world, and the love of money, are represented as
   radical sins, from which many others proceed.

   Pride and revenge are exhibited as not only odious, but incompatible
   with the divine favor. Purity of heart, and heavenly mindedness, with
   trust in God. and submission to his will, are; in this system,
   cardinal, virtues.

   5. The moral precepts of the New Testament were exemplified in the
   lives of the apostles and primitive Christians; and especially, and to
   the utmost perfection, in the example of Jesus Christ. It is impossible
   to conceive a character more perfect than that given by the
   evangelists, of the Founder of the Christian religion; and it has
   already been observed, that this character, embracing every variety of
   excellence, often exhibited in delicate and difficult circumstances, is
   delineated by a simple narrative of facts. There is no panegyric; no
   effort or art to excite admiration; but the writers merely inform us
   what Jesus said, did, and suffered. From this narrative we learn, that
   he connected himself with no sect, and courted the favor of neither the
   rich nor the poor. He adopted none of the errors or prejudices of his
   nation; but by his discourses and his conduct, showed that he acted
   from far higher views than national prejudices. The apparent sanctity
   of the Pharisees, he denounced as hypocrisy;--the traditions of the
   elders, as subversive of the law of God;--the sceptical opinion of the
   Sadducees, as proceeding from ignorance of the true meaning of the
   Scriptures.

   Jesus Christ continually turned the attention of his hearers, from
   earthly to heavenly things, as alone worthy of their affections and
   pursuit. Although he flattered no class of men, his attention was
   particularly directed to the poor; their spiritual necessities and
   their bodily afflictions excited his most tender compassion; and to
   them he addressed many kind and encouraging declarations. But his
   healing power was exerted in behalf of all applicants, rich and pool;
   and without regard to their sect or nation. Jews, Samaritans, Heathens,
   Publicans, and sinners, were the objects of his compassion. He was not
   deterred by the proud prejudices of the Scribes and Pharisees, from
   associating with penitents, however vile and infamous they had before
   been. He graciously received returning sinners, comforted them with the
   assurance of pardon, and permitted them to manifest their grateful
   affection to his person; by, the most expressive signs and actions.

   He manifested the kindest sympathy with his friends in their
   afflictions, weeping with those that wept, and often exerting his
   omnipotence in raising their dear relations from the bed of sickness,
   or from death. And although he often uttered severe rebukes against the
   incorrigibly wicked, and was sometimes grieved and angry with them, yet
   his compassion towards them never failed; and even when their day of
   grace was ended, he wept over them with the most affecting tenderness.

   Jesus Christ was often brought into conflict with insidious, malignant,
   and learned adversaries. They attacked him with deliberate craft, and.
   proposed to him questions on delicate and difficult subjects, to which
   he was required to return an immediate answer; but in no case of this
   sort was he ever confounded, or even puzzled by the cunning craftiness
   of his enemies. His answers were so appropriate, and so fraught with
   wisdom, that his adversaries were commonly confounded, and the audience
   filled with admiration.

   The parables of Christ are unparalleled for beauty and force, in the
   species of composition to which they belong. But this is the smallest
   part of their excellence. They contain so much important truth, and so
   happily adapted to the subject, and the occasion, that often, the.
   persons intended to be reproved by them, were constrained to give
   judgment against themselves. In these discourses, the leading doctrines
   of the Gospel are exhibited in a beautiful dress of allegory, which
   rivets the attention, and greatly aids us in understanding the. fulness
   and freeness of the grace of the. Gospel. They are also prophetical of
   the rejection of the Jews, and of the calling of the Gentiles; of the
   various reception of the Gospel by different classes, of hearers; of
   the mixture of sincere and unsound Christians, of which the Church
   should consist; of the cruel persecutions which the followers of Christ
   should endure; and of the final overthrow and destruction of his
   enemies.

   Jesus Christ spake, in all his discourses; as never man spake. He
   removed the false glosses which had been put on the law, and set its
   precepts in their proper light. He mingled the dogmas of no
   philosophical system with his instructions. He entered into no
   metaphysical and abstruse disquisition, but taught the truth with
   simplicity and authority.

   His zeal for the honor of God, and for the purity and sanctity of his
   worship, and his dislike of all human inventions and will-worship, are
   manifest, in all his conduct. A spirit of fervent and, elevated
   devotion, was a remarkable characteristic of Jesus of Nazareth. Whole
   nights he spent in prayer; and before day he would retire for the
   purposes of devotion. He was in the habit of praying and giving thanks
   on all occasions; but his devotion was free from all tincture of
   superstition, or enthusiasm. He taught, that not the. words, but the
   heart;--not the length of prayers, but their, spirit, was regarded.

   His benevolence, meekness, and laborious diligence, in promoting the
   welfare of men, were manifested, every day of his life. But in his acts
   of mercy, and in his most extraordinary miracles, there was no
   appearance of parade or ostentation. "He went about doing good," but he
   sought no glory from men. He was humble, retired, and contented with
   the lowest state of poverty.

   When the people applauded him, he withdrew unto some other place. When
   they would have made him a king, he escaped from their hands. When they
   asked curious questions, he directed them to something important. When
   they uttered unmeaning expressions of praise, he took occasion to
   announce some important truth, or deliver some interesting discourse.

   In nothing did he discover more profound wisdom,. than in declining to
   interfere, in any case, with temporal concerns, and disputes about
   earthly possessions. He showed by his conduct, what lie solemnly
   declared on his trial, that, "his kingdom was not of this world."

   In his intercourse with his disciples, we observe a sweet mixture of
   dignity and gentleness, of faithfulness and humble condescension to
   their weakness and prejudices.. No wonder that they should love such a
   Master. But his last discourses with them before his passion, and the
   remarkable prayer offered in their behalf, for affectionate tenderness,
   and the sweet spirit of consolation which pervade them, are altogether
   inimitable. How flat and unsatisfactory are the conversations of
   Socrates with his friends, when compared with those of Christ, recorded
   in the xiv, xv, and xvi chapters of the Gospel of St. John! Indeed, it
   would be impossible to refer to any discourses, in any language, which
   could bear a comparison with this valedictory of Christ: and that which
   should enhance our admiration of the pure benevolence of the author;
   is, that he was aware, that his own sufferings were near, and would be
   most cruel and ignominious; and vet his attention is turned to the case
   of his sorrowful disciples; and all that he says has relation to them.
   The institution of the Eucharistical Supper, intended to be
   commemorative of his death, was attended with circumstances, which
   exhibit the character of Jesus, in a very peculiar and interesting
   light. This scene will be best understood by a perusal of the simple
   and affecting narrative of the evangelists, to which the reader is
   referred.

   The last thing in the character of Christ, which I shall bring into
   view at this time, is the patience and fortitude with which he endured
   sufferings, which were intense and overwhelming, beyond conception.
   There is something mysterious in this whole affair. The intense agonies
   which Jesus suffered, seem to have had no connexion with external
   circumstances. When he was betrayed, deserted, and arrested, he
   discovered no signs of fear or perturbation. He gave himself up, and
   submitted with unruffled composure, to every species of contumely and
   insult. While his trial was going on before the Sanhedrim, and before
   Pilate, he maintained, for the most part, a dignified silence, uttering
   no reproaches or complaints; not even speaking in his own defence. When
   particularly interrogated by the judges, he answered directly to the
   questions proposed, and avowed himself to be the Messiah, the Son of
   God, and the King of Israel. Under the mockery and insult which were
   heaped upon him, he remained perfectly composed, and uttered not a word
   indicative of impatience or resentment. "As a sheep before her shearers
   is dumb, so he opened not his mouth." When he was bewailed by the
   daughters of Jerusalem, as he ascended the hill of Calvary, bearing his
   cross, he requested them not to weep for him, but for themselves and
   their children, on account of the calamities that were coming on that
   devoted city. While suspended on the cross, he saw his beloved mother
   among the spectators, and knowing that she would need a friend and
   protector, he recommended her to the care of the. disciple he most
   tenderly loved. Although no compassion was mingled with the vindictive
   feelings with which he was persecuted, yet he set a glorious example of
   that most difficult duty, of loving our enemies: as says the apostle
   Peter, "Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
   that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile
   found in his month; who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when
   he suffered; he threatened not, but committed himself to him that
   judgeth righteously." Among his last words, before he expired, was a
   prayer for those that were then engaged in crucifying him;--"Father
   forgive them, for they know not what they do." A penitent thief, who
   was crucified with him, implored his blessing and remembrance, when he
   should come to the possession of his kingdom, to whom he replied, "This
   day shalt thou be with me in paradise." And finally, he said, "Father,
   into thy hands I commit my spirit," and bowed his head, and died.

   The moral excellence of the character of Christ is very remarkable, for
   uniting in perfection, qualities which among men are considered almost
   incompatible, He exhibited a complete indifference to the possessions
   and glory of the world, and a devout and heavenly temper, without the
   least mixture of austerity. He combined uniform dignity, with humility
   and condescension:--manifested strong indignation against all manner of
   sin, and against impenitent sinners, but the most affectionate
   tenderness, towards every humble penitent. He united the spirit of
   elevated devotion also, with a life of activity and incessant exertion.
   While he held free intercourse with men of all classes, he adopted the
   prejudices, and spared the vices of none. On this subject, I will take
   the liberty of quoting a passage from an excellent discourse of Dr.
   Charming, referred to already: "I will only observe," says the eloquent
   author, speaking of the character of Christ, "that it had one
   distinction, which, more than any thing, forms a perfect character. It
   was made up of contrasts: in other words, it was a union of
   excellencies which are not easily reconciled, which seem at first sight
   incongruous, but which, when blended, and duly proportioned, constitute
   moral harmony, and attract with equal power, love, and veneration. For
   example, we discover in Jesus Christ an unparalleled dignity of
   character, a consciousness of greatness, never discovered or approached
   by any other individual in history; and yet this was blended with a
   condescension, loveliness, and unostentatious simplicity, which had
   never before been thought consistent with greatness. In like manner, he
   puked an utter superiority to the world, to its pleasures and ordinary
   interests, with suavity of manners, and freedom from austerity. He
   joined to strong feeling and self-possession, an indignant sensibility
   to sin, and compassion to the sinner; an intense devotion to his work,
   and calmness under opposition and ill success; a universal
   philanthropy, and a susceptibility of private attachments; the
   authority which became the Saviour of the world, and the tenderness and
   gratitude of a son."

   The salutary effects of Christianity on communities and individuals,
   open a wide field for important remarks; but it is a subject which we
   have not time to pursue; yet we must not pass it over in entire
   silence. The argument from this topic may, however, be reduced to a
   point. Take a survey of the whole world, at this time, and let an
   impartial judgment be formed, of the condition of all the nations; and
   let the question be answered, whether Christian nations are in a less
   favorable, or more favorable condition, than others. And again, whether
   among Christians, those nations who have the free use of the Bible, and
   are carefully instructed in the doctrines of Christianity, are in a
   better or worse condition, than those to whom the Scriptures are
   interdicted, and who are permitted to remain in ignorance of the
   religion which they profess? The answers to these questions are so
   obvious, that I cannot but presume, that all readers will be of the
   same mind. It may then be asked, would a vile imposture be the means of
   meliorating the condition of the world, and prove salutary in
   proportion as it is known and obeyed? "I speak as unto wise men judge
   ye what I say."

   We have, moreover, seen, in our own time, the wonderful effects of the
   Gospel, in civilizing some of the most barbarous people on the face of
   the earth. Men who seemed to be sunk to a level with the beasts, have
   been reclaimed, enlightened, and exalted, to a participation of the
   blessings of civilized life--their ferocious temper being completely
   subdued and softened. Look at Greenland, at Africa, at the islands in
   the Pacific; and nearer home, at the Cherokees, Choctaws, and other
   Indian tribes, and see what the Gospel can effect! I know not what
   infidels think of these things, but for my own part, I should not
   esteem one coming from the dead, or a voice of thunder from the
   heavens. so undoubted an evidence of the truth of .the Gospel, as these
   effects. Will a series of falsehoods produce such effects as these?

   I know that it has been objected, that Christianity has been the cause
   of many bloody wars and cruel persecutions;--but this is impossible.
   That religion which breathes nothing but benevolence and peace, and
   which requires its disciples not to resist evil, but freely to forgive
   their most malignant enemies, never can be the cause of war and
   persecution. It may indeed be the occasion, and no doubt has been made
   the occasion. of such evils; but it would be absurd to attribute to
   Christianity, the evils of which it has been the innocent. occasion,
   when its own spirit is in direct opposition to those evils. As well
   might we charge civil government with all the wars and tumults which it
   has occasioned. As reasonably might we accuse liberty, as being the
   cause of all the atrocities of the French revolution. The truth is,
   that the wickedness of man is the cause of these evils; and the most
   excellent things in the universe, may be made the occasion of exciting,
   or calling it into exercise. Christ foretold that his religion would be
   an occasion of family discord; and to express the certainty of the
   event predicted, he said, "Think not not I am come to send peace on
   earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword; which some superficial
   readers have strangely misconstrued, as though he had signified, that
   it was the tendency of his religion to produce strife among friends. No
   man can remain in error on this subject who will take the pains to read
   the New Testament. And I will venture to predict, or rather to publish
   what is already predicted, that as soon as the world shall sincerely
   embrace the Christian religion, wars will cease to the ends of the
   earth. Then shall men beat their swords into plough shares, and their
   spears into pruning hooks, and learn war no more.

   But the salutary effects of the Gospel on those individuals who
   cordially embrace it, furnish the most manifest proof of its divinity.
   flow often, by the secret, powerful influence of the truths of the
   Bible, have the proud been humbled; the impure rendered chaste; the
   unjust, honest; the cruel and revengeful, meek and forgiving; the
   drunkard, temperate; the profane, reverent; and the false swearer and
   liar, conscientious in declaring nothing but the truth! Under the
   influence of what other system are such salutary changes effected? Will
   it be said, that many who profess to experience such a change, prove
   themselves to be hypocrites? Admitted; but does this evince that they
   who give evidence of sincerity by the most incontestible proofs, all
   their lives, are also hypocrites? All men wish to be thought honest;
   but if many are discovered to be knaves, does this prove that there is
   not an honest man in the world?

   But however this argument may affect those who have had no experience
   of the power of the Gospel, it will have great weight with all those
   who have, by means of the truth, been converted from the error of their
   ways. There are thousands who can attest that they have experienced the
   salutary efficacy of the Bible, in turning them away from their
   iniquities and enkindling within them the love of God, and of virtue.
   They cannot but believe that the Christian religion is from God, and
   are persuaded that no imposture could so elevate and sanctify the
   mind:--that no human device could possess such a power over the
   conscience and the heart, as they have experienced from the Scriptures.
   These persons, therefore, may truly be said to have the witness of the
   truth in themselves.

   But there is an efficacy in the truths of the Bible, not only to guide
   and santify, but also to afford consolation to the afflicted, in body
   or mind. Indeed, the Gospel brings peace into every bosom, where it is
   cordially received. When the conscience is pierced with the stings of
   guilt, and the soul writhes under a wound which no human medicine can
   heal, the promises of the Gospel are like the balm of Gilead, a
   sovereign cure for this intolerable and deeply seated malady. Under its
   cheering influence, the broken spirit is healed, and the burden of
   despair is removed far away. The Gospel, like an angel of mercy, can
   bring consolation into the darkest scenes of adversity; it can
   penetrate the dungeon, and soothe the sorrows of the penitent in his
   chains, and on his bed of straw. It has power to give courage to the
   heart, and to brighten the countenance of the man who meets death on
   the scaffold, or on the gibbet, if its precious invitations to the
   chief of sinners, be sincerely embraced. It mitigates the sorrows of
   the bereaved, and wipes away the bitter tears, occasioned by the
   painful separation of affectionate friends and relatives. By the bright
   prospects which it opens, and the lively hopes which it inspires, the
   darkness of the tomb is illumined; so that Christians are enabled, in
   faith of the resurrection of the body, to commit the remains of their
   dearest friends to the secure sepulchre, in confident hope, that after
   a short sleep, they will awake to life everlasting.

   The cottages of the poor, are often blessed with the consolation of the
   Gospel, which is peculiarly adapted to the children of affliction and
   poverty. It was one of the signs of Jesus being the true Messiah, "that
   the poor had the Gospel preached unto them." Here, it produces
   contentment, resignation, mutual kindness, and the longing after
   immortality. The aged and infirm, who, by the gradual failure of their
   faculties, or by disease and decrepitude are shut out from the business
   and enjoyments of this world, may find in the word of God, a fountain
   of consolation. They- may, while imbued with its celestial spirit, look
   upon the world without the least regard for its loss, and may rejoice
   in the prospect before them, with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
   The Gospel can render tolerable, even the yoke of slavery, and the
   chains of the oppressor. How often is the pious slave, through the
   blessed influence of the word of God, a thousand Limes happier than his
   lordly master! He cares not for the short deprivation of liberty; he
   knows and feels that he is "Christ's freeman," and believes "that all
   things work together for his good," and that "these light afflictions
   which are for a moment, will work out for him a fax more exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory!" But, moreover, this glorious gospel is an
   antidote to death itself. He that does the sayings of Christ shall
   never taste of death; that is, of death as a curse;--he shall never
   feel the envenomed sting of death. How often does it overspread the
   spirit of the departing saint, with serenity! How often does it
   elevate, and fill with celestial joy, the soul which is just leaving
   the earthly house of this tabernacle? It actually renders, in many
   instances, the bed of the dying, a place of sweet repose. No terrors
   hover over them;--no anxious care corrodes their spirit;--no burden
   oppresses their heart. All is light;--all is hope and assurance;--all
   is joy and triumph!

   Now, the question to be decided is, whether a book which is replete
   with such sublime and correct views of theology;--which exhibits the
   true history and true character of man, without flattery, distortion,
   or exaggeration; and which possesses such an astonishing power of
   penetrating the human heart and affecting the conscience,--which gives
   us information on the very points, with which it is most important that
   we should be acquainted;--which opens to us the future world, and shows
   us how we may attain its felicity and glory;--which exhibits a perfect
   system of moral duty adapted to our nature and circumstances, and free
   from all the defects of other systems of morality; forbidding nothing
   which is innocent, and requiring nothing which is not reasonable and
   virtuous;--which reduces all duty to a few general principles, and yet
   illustrates the application of these principles by a multitude of
   particular precepts, addressed to persons in every relation of life,
   and exemplifies them, by setting before us the lives of holy men, who
   are portrayed according to truth, with such imperfections, as
   experience teaches us, belong to the best men;--which delineates the
   character of Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, with such a
   perfection of moral excellencies, by simply relating his words,
   actions, and sufferings, that nothing can be taken from it, or added to
   it, without detracting from its worth;--and finally, which contains the
   true sources of consolation for every species of human suffering, and
   comfort in death itself. I say, is it reasonable to believe, that such
   a book is the production of vile impostors; and especially, of
   uneducated fishermen of Galilee?

   Would such men have fallen into no palpable blunders in theology or
   morality? Could they have preserved so beautiful a harmony and
   consistency between all the parts? Could they have exhibited such a
   character as that of Jesus Christ? and while they introduce him acting
   and speaking so often, and in circumstances so peculiar and difficult,
   never ascribe to him any error or weakness, in word or deed? Would
   impostors have denounced all manner of falsehood and deceit, as is done
   in the New Testament? Would they have insisted so much on holiness,
   even in the thoughts and purposes of the heart? Could they have so
   perfectly adapted their forgery to the constitution of the human mind,
   and to the circumstances of men? Is it, probable that they would have
   possessed the wisdom to avoid all the prejudices of their nation, and
   all connexion with existing sects and civil institutions? And finally,
   could they have provided so effectually for the consolation of the
   afflicted? What man now upon earth could compose even the discourses,
   said by the evangelists to have been spoken by Christ?

   If any man can bring himself, after an impartial examination of the
   Scriptures, to believe that they were written by unprincipled
   impostors, then he may believe, that au untutored savage might
   construct a ship of the line; that a child might have written the
   Iliad, or Paradise Lost: or even that the starry firmament was the work
   of mere creatures. No: it cannot be, that this is a forgery. No man or
   set of men ever had sufficient talents and knowledge, to forge such a
   book as the Bible. It evidently transcends all human effort. It has
   upon its face the impress of divinity. It shines with a light, which
   from its clearness and its splendor, shows itself to be celestial. It
   possesses the energy and penetrating influence which bespeak the
   omnipotence and omniscience of its Author. It has the effect of
   enlightening, elevating, purifying, directing, and comforting all those
   who cordially receive it. Surely, then, it is the word of God, and we
   will hold it fast, as the best blessing which God has vouchsafed to
   man.

   O precious gospel! Will any merciless liana endeavor to tear away from
   our hearts this best, this last, this sweetest consolation? Would you
   darken the only avenue through which one ray of hope can enter? Would
   you tear from the aged and infirm poor, the only prop on which their
   souls can repose in peace? Would you deprive the dying of their only
   source of consolation? Would you rob the world of its richest treasure?
   Would you let loose the flood-gates of every vice, and bring back upon
   the earth, the horrors of superstition, or the atrocities of atheism?
   Then endeavor to subvert the Gospel--throw around you the fire-brands
   of infidelity--laugh at religion, and make a mock of futurity;--but be
   assured, that for all these things, God will bring you into judgment.
   But no; I will not believe, that any who reflect on what has been said
   in these pages, will ever cherish a thought so diabolical. 1 will
   persuade myself, that a regard for the welfare of their country, if no
   higher motive, will induce them to respect the Christian Religion. And
   every pious heart will say, RATHER LET THE SUN BE DARKENED IN THE
   HEAVENS, THAN THE PRECIOUS LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL BE EXTINGUISHED!

CHAPTER XI.

   THE SCRIPTURES OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT, WERE WRITTEN BY THE
   INSPIRATION OF GOD; AND THIS INSPIRATION, HOWEVER IT MAY BE
   DISTINGUISHED, WAS PLENARY; THAT IS, THE WRITERS WERE UNDER AN
   INFALLIBLE GUIDANCE, 130TH AS IT RELATES TO THE IDEAS AND WORDS: AND
   YET, THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE, HABITS, AND PECULIAR DISPOSITIONS OF THE
   WRITERS, WERE NOT SUPERSEDED.

   HAVING endeavored to establish the authenticy of the Scriptures, I come
   now to say something respecting the inspiration of the writers of the
   several books. These two subjects are, it is true, involved, in each
   other; and many of the arguments for the former, are conclusive in
   favor of the latter; but still, there is a distinction which it is
   important to observe. A book may be authentic, without having the least
   claim to inspiration, as are all true narratives of facts, written by
   men of veracity, in the exercise of their unassisted powers. The gospel
   history may be established on the common principles of human testimony,
   in the same manner, as any other history. Indeed, this must be done, in
   the order of proof, before any convincing argument can be formed, in
   favor of divine revelation. Accordingly, all judicious writers on the
   Evidences of Christianity, first attempt to establish the facts
   recorded in the Gospels, by an appeal to merely human testimony. This
   distinction is so clear, and practically so important, that many
   persons believe in the facts--miracles as well as others--and yet have
   no conviction that the history of these events was written by divine
   inspiration. This is understood to be the case in regard to most of
   those called Unitarians. Dr. Priestley, in his "Institutes of the
   Christian Religion," has established the authenticity of the facts,
   recorded by the evangelists, with great force of reasoning; and yet, in
   the same work, he utterly denies the plenary inspiration of these
   writers; but alleges, that they were men of veracity, and that their
   testimony should be received, just as we receive that of other credible
   historians; but without ascribing infallibility to them The same
   opinions have been maintained by many others. The authenticity of the
   facts is sufficient to demonstrate, that the Christian religion is of
   divine origin; but it does. not follow, as a matter of course, that the
   historian who gives an account of the facts orr which it rests, was
   inspired. This is a distinct inquiry; and, although, not so vitally
   important as the former, yet is of great moment, and deserves a serious
   and impartial consideration.

   It may be proper, also, in this place, to distinguish between
   inspiration, and that illumination, which every true Christian must
   receive, and which is the foundation of that saving faith which is
   produced in the mind, by the operation of the Holy Spirit. The
   distinction is, that the object of inspiration is commonly to reveal
   some new truths; or more clearly to reveal such as were before but
   obscurely revealed; or, it is intended, to direct the mind, in a
   supernatural way, to write and speak certain things; and so
   superintends or strengthens its faculties, that it is enabled to
   communicate, with unerring certainty, truths before known; or, to form
   ideas and adopt expressions so sublime, as to be above the range of the
   natural powers of the person. But the illumination of the Holy Spirit
   communicates no new truths, but enables the soul spiritually to
   apprehend truths already revealed. Here then is the grand distinction
   between those spiritual influences which all Christians enjoy, and
   enthusiasm, which claims something of the nature of inspiration. The
   sober Christian can appeal to the word of God, as containing all the
   ideas by which his mind is affected, in its highest elevations of joy
   and love: but the enthusiast departs from the written word, and trusts
   to impulses, impressions on the imagination, immediate suggestions,
   dreams, or supposed visions. If these impulses or suggestions were from
   the Spirit of God, they would be strictly of the nature of inspiration.
   And, accordingly, most fanatics believe themselves to be inspired; but
   however strong their persuasion, we are not bound to believe in their
   pretensions, unless they can exhibit these external proofs, by which
   God is pleased to give attestation to those communications which he
   makes to men.

   There is also a difference between inspiration, and revelation. All
   revelations are not made by a suggestion of truth to the mind of an
   individual. God often spike to people of old, by audible voices; and
   communicated his will by the missions of angels. Many persons have thus
   received divine revelations, who had no pretensions to inspiration. All
   the people of Israel, who stood before God at Mount Sinai, heard his
   voice, uttering the ten commandments, and yet no one would say, that
   all these were inspired. So, also, when Christ was upon earth, in more
   instances than one, a voice was heard declaring, that he was the
   beloved Son of God. Indeed, all who had the opportunity of hearing
   Christ's discourses, might be said to receive a revelation immediately
   from God; but it would be absurd to say, that all these were inspired.
   Dr. Dick is of opinion, that the word revelation would be more
   expressive, as being more comprehensive than suggestion, which last
   conveys the idea of an operation on the mind; whereas, truth, in many
   cases was made known, in other ways. But for the reasons stated above,
   it would not do to substitute the word revelation for inspiration;
   inasmuch as, multitudes received revelations, who had no claim to
   inspiration. And when inspiration is confined to those who wrote the
   books of Scripture, no other word would so clearly express the idea.

   Inspiration has, by theologians, been distinguished into three kinds;
   that of superintendence, of suggestion, and elevation. The first of
   these takes place, when a historian is influenced, by the Holy Spirit,
   to write, and in writing is so directed as to select those facts and
   circumstances, which will answer the end proposed; and so assisted and
   strengthened in the narrative of events, as to he preserved from all
   error and mistake. The facts need not be revealed, because they may be
   well known to the writer from his own observation, and may be deeply
   impressed on his memory; but, no man can avoid inaccuracies and
   mistakes, in a narrative of facts, long past. If it is important that
   such a narrative be exempt from error, the writer must be inspired. But
   as the chief object of inspiration is, to communicate truths before
   unknown; so, the inspiration of suggestion is requisite, in all such
   eases; as when the prophets were inspired to predict the revolutions of
   empires; or, to communicate a message from God to a whole people, or to
   an individual, the ideas must of course, have been immediately
   suggested, by the Holy Spirit. The third species of inspiration, is,
   when, by a divine influence, persons are enabled to bring forth
   productions, in speaking or writing, far more sublime and excellent,
   than they could have attained, by the exercise of their own faculties.
   Thus, often, women, under the inspiration of God, have instantly
   uttered, in elevated strains of poetry, discourses in praise of God,
   which, by their unassisted powers, they could never have produced. In
   these compositions, there may be no revelation of new truth; nor is
   there a mere superintendence of the human faculties, as in the first
   case, was described; but the powers of the mind, are, for the occasion,
   wonderfully elevated above their common level, so that the conceptions
   are more vivid and sublime, and expressed in language more appropriate
   and striking, than would have naturally occurred to them. By an
   inspiration of this sort, David wrote the Psalms, and Solomon the
   Proverbs, and the Speakers in the book of Job, the sublime discourses,
   which are there recorded. Many things of this kind, are also found in
   the writings of the prophets.

   Here, another question of some perplexity, demands our attention. It
   is, whether the words of Scripture, as well as the ideas, were given by
   inspiration. On the one hand, it is alleged, that there is no necessity
   for supposing that the words used in communicating revealed truth,
   should be suggested by the Holy Spirit; and that the fact proves that
   no such inspiration existed, because the style of each of the writers
   is peculiar, and accords precisely with his education, disposition, and
   turn of mind. But on the other hand, it is argued that unless the words
   were inspired, as well as the ideas we cannot be certain, that the
   writer has, in any case, communicated accurately, the mind of the
   Spirits; for, men are liable to mistake, in the selection of
   appropriate words, as much as in any thing else; and as men often fail
   in conveying their own ideas, in language which correctly expresses
   their meaning; so, also, they might make similar mistakes in the use of
   language, to express ideas received by inspiration; if in this matter
   they were left to the guidance of their own minds. It has also been
   plausibly urged in favor of inspiration extending to the words, that we
   can scarcely conceive of a revelation of truths to the mind, without
   supposing, that they were clothed in language. We cannot even think
   distinctly, much less reason conclusively, on any subject, without the
   intervention of words.

   Now, it is probable, that, that has occured in this controversy, which
   has in many others; namely, that both parties are right; or, rather,
   that the truth will be fully possessed, by adopting the views
   entertained on both sides, and endeavoring to reconcile them. The fact
   is, that the same principles which apply to the ideas, may, without any
   alteration, be applied to the words. When the truths revealed were
   before unknown to the inspired person; and, especially--as seems often
   to have been the case with the prophets--when they did not fully
   comprehend the import of what was revealed, it is necessary to suppose,
   that the words, as well as ideas, were immediately suggested by the
   Holy Spirit. This was remarkably the case, when the apostles and others
   received the gift of tongues; which was nothing else but the
   inspiration of words, as they were needed, for the communication of the
   truths of the Gospel.

   But as in the narration of well-known facts, the writer did not need a
   continual suggestion of every idea, but only to be so superintended, as
   to be preserved from error; in the use of language, in recording such
   familiar things, there existed no necessity that every word should be
   inspired; but there was the same need of a directing and superintending
   influence, as in regard to the things themselves. Here then, we see,
   that the language of the sacred writers might be preserved from
   impropriety, and inaccuracy; and yet, all the characteristics of style,
   peculiar to each writer, be retained. Just as if a master should so
   guide the hand of a child in writing, that the pen should be actually
   moved by the pupil; but governed and directed by the master, so as not
   to transgress the limits prescribed. Or, this superintendence, both as
   to ideas and words, may be illustrated, by the case of a father
   conducting a child along a narrow path. The child walks by its own
   activity, and takes steps according to its ability; but the father
   preserves it from falling, and keeps it in the straight path. Just so
   it is with men, when under the superintending influence of the Holy
   Spirit. Their own powers of understanding, memory, and invention, are
   not superseded, but only directed, and preserved from inaccuracy and
   error; but the man pursues his own peculiar method of thinking,
   reasoning, and expression. Ile speaks or writes in the language which
   he has learned, and uses that idiom and style, which have become
   habitual; so that inspired men, will, according to this theory, retain
   their peculiarity of style and expression, just as fully as if they
   were writing or speaking, without inspiration.

   Some object to this theory of superintendence, under the impression,
   that it is less perfect, than if every thing was inspired by direct
   suggestion of the Holy Spirit. But there is really no foundation for
   this objection. It certainly is a matter of no consequence, how our
   knowledge is obtained, if only it is rendered infallibly certain. There
   are many things, concerning which we could not acquire a greater degree
   of assurance than we already possess, by inspiration of any kind: and
   such knowledge, acquired by the exercise of reason or intuition, is not
   the less valuable, because it has been obtained in a natural way.
   Indeed, these natural faculties, by which we are so constituted as to
   be capable of certain knowledge of the first principles of truth, are
   the gift of God, as much as any inspiration can be; and the clear
   intuitive knowledge, which we .possess of certain truths, may be
   considered as a sort of permanent inspiration; for, suppose a man, by a
   constant plenary inspiration, to be made absolutely sure of the truth
   of certain propositions, so that he could not entertain any doubt
   respecting them, in what respect would there be any difference between
   this, and the intuitive perception of self-evident principles, which
   every rational man by nature possesses? There would, then, be nothing
   gained by the inspiration of direct suggestion, in regard to our
   knowledge of those things, of which we already possess intuitive
   certainty; so, it is also evident, that in relation to all our
   knowledge acquired by experience, or testimony, we only need such an
   influence, as will enable us to communicate what ought to be recorded,
   for the benefit of the church, and to do this without error, either as
   to matter or manner.

   Some, who do not deny the inspiration of the sacred writers, in the
   general, have thought it necessary to make concessions on this subject,
   which are not called for, from the nature of the case, and have thus
   involved the cause which they defend, in real difficulties. They have
   granted, that while, in all matters of real importance, the penmen of
   the Scriptures were guided by a plenary inspiration; yet, in trivial
   matters, and the relation of unimportant circumstances, they were left
   to their own unassisted powers; and in such matters; have, therefore,
   fallen into mistakes, such as are incident to other honest historians,
   in similar circumstances. Now, no evil or inconvenience would result
   from this hypothesis, if the line could be definitely drawn, between
   the parts of the book, written by inspiration, and those in which the
   writers were left, to themselves. But as no human wisdom is sufficient
   to draw this line, the effect of this opinion is, to introduce
   uncertainty and doubt, in a matter, concerning which assurance is of
   the utmost importance. And it is in itself an improbable supposition,
   that the spirit of God should infallibly guide a writer in some parts
   of his discourse, and forsake him in other parts. If we find a witness
   mistaken in some particulars, it weakens our confidence in his general
   testimony. And could it be shown, that the evangelists had fallen into
   palpable mistakes, in facts of minor importance, it would be impossible
   to demonstrate, that they wrote any thing by inspiration.

   The case of Paul is often adduced to prove, that a writer, who, for the
   most part, was inspired, may, in particular cases, be left to follow
   his own opinions. [45] If the meaning here ascribed to this apostle,
   and which, perhaps, is the most obvious, should be admitted, yet it.
   would riot authorise the opinion which we are now opposing. It would
   only follow, that in these few excepted cases, Paul was not inspired;
   which would leave us to enjoy full confidence in what he says, in all
   other cases, as being spoken by divine inspiration. But it may well be
   doubted, whether this was the true meaning of the apostle. It is much
   more probable, that all that he intended to teach, was, that our Lord
   Jesus Christ had delivered no opinion on the point which he was
   treating; but that he, by the aid of the spirit which was in him,
   expressed an opinion, which evidently he intended should be
   authoritative. And he plainly intimates, that be spoke by inspiration,
   when he says, "And I think also that I have the spirit of God." The
   import of this declaration, according to the usage of the New
   Testament, is, that Paul was persuaded that he was inspired, in
   uttering the sentiments which he did. The words "I think" should not be
   interpreted as signifying any doubt or uncertainty, for that is not at
   all the meaning of the original; but as being the expression of the
   conviction of his own mind. There is, therefore, no need to suppose,
   that Paul intended to intimate, that lie wrote any thing without the
   aid of divine inspiration. It would be strange, indeed, that lie who
   was inspired for all other purposes, should be left to himself in this
   one instance: and this is not to be reckoned among the least important
   matters which have fallen from his pen.

   The true doctrine of inspiration then, is, SUCH A DIVINE INFLUENCE ON
   THE MINDS OF THE SACRED WRITERS, AS RENDERED THEM EXEMPT FROM ERROR,
   BOTH IN REGARD TO THE IDEAS AND WORDS.

   This is properly called PLENARY inspiration. Nothing can be conceived
   more satisfactory. Certainty, infallible certainty, is the utmost that
   can be desired, in any narrative; and if we have this, in the sacred
   Scriptures, there is nothing more to be wished, in regard to this
   matter.

   That the Scriptures of the Old Testament were appealed to, and
   constantly spoken of; as inspired, and as free from error, is capable
   of the clearest proof. Christ said to the Jews, "Search the Scriptures,
   for in them ye think ye have eternal life, but they are they which
   testify of me." "For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me,
   for he wrote of me." On another occasion, he said, "Ye do err, not
   knowing the Scriptures," where, it is evidently implied, that the
   Scriptures are an unerring rule. In the same chapter, it is recorded,
   that Jesus confounded the Pharisees by asking them, how David could, IN
   SPIRIT, call Christ, Lord, when he was his son. Again, Christ, after
   his resurrection, expresses this sentiment in the strongest terms:
   "These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you;
   THAT ALL THINGS MUST BE FULFILLED, which were written in the Law of
   Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then
   opened he their understandings, that they should understand the
   Scriptures; and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved
   Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, on the third day." In the
   preceding part of the same discourse, this idea is also clearly
   exhibited. "Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to
   believe all that the prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ to have
   suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at
   Moses and all. the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
   Scriptures, the things concerning himself. And they said one to
   another, did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by
   the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?" So, also, in the
   garden of Gethsemene, our Lord in addressing Peter, said, "Thinkest
   thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give
   me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the
   Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be." The same infallible
   authority is ascribed to the Old Testament, by Christ, in his dispute
   with the Jews, recorded in the tenth chapter of John. "Jesus answered
   them, is it not written in your law, I said ye are gods? If he called
   them gods to whom the word of God came; and THE SCRIPTURE CANNOT BE
   BROKEN." We have, besides, many passages, in which the evangelists
   refer to the Holy Scriptures, as an infallible standard of truth. "But
   though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not
   on him, that the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which
   he spake--Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of
   the Lord revealed?" "Therefore, they could not believe, because that
   Esaias said again--he hath blinded their eyes," &c. "For these things
   were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall
   not be broken. And again, another Scripture saith, they shall look on
   him whom they have pierced."

   The apostles are not less explicit, in testifying to the inspiration of
   the Scriptures of the Old Testament, than Christ and the evangelists.
   Paul, in his second epistle to Timothy, puts him in mind, "that from a
   child he had known the Holy Scriptures, which were able to make him
   wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus;" and then
   adds, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
   for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
   unto all good works." The Scriptures, which Timothy knew from his
   childhood, must have been the books of the Old Testament, for, at that
   time, no others had been written: but when Paul goes on to declare,
   that "all Scripture was given by inspiration of God," he might have
   included under this general expression, all the books of the New
   Testament, which had been published, before his second imprisonment at
   Rome; and this would comprehend, probably, the first three Gospels, the
   Acts of the Apostles, and all his own epistles, besides; for this seems
   to have been the last of Paul's writings; for in the close of this
   epistle, he says, "For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my
   departure is at hand." And that, about this time, the writings of Paul
   were, by the Church, reckoned among the sacred Scriptures, we learn
   from the second epistle of Peter, which was probably written about this
   time, or a little before. His words are remarkable, as containing the
   only clear testimony, on record, of one apostle, to the writings of
   another. "And account," says he, "that the long suffering of our Lord
   is salvation, even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the
   wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you. As, also, in all his
   epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things
   hard to be understood; which they that are unlearned and unstable
   pervert, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own
   destruction." Hence, it would appear, that Paul's epistles were now
   well known, and were reckoned among the other Scriptures, by the
   apostle Peter. Certainly, then, Paul himself might have included them,
   as well as the other published books of the New Testament, under the
   phrase "all Scripture;" and if so, this passage will contain a strong
   testimony to the inspiration of the whole of the Old Testament, and a
   large part of the New Testament. And admitting the facts, of Paul's
   miraculous conversion, divine mission as an apostle, and that he was
   richly endowed with the gifts of tongues, of healing, of prophecy, &c.,
   we cannot deny that he is a witness, in this case, on whom we may
   repose the most perfect confidence.

   The apostle Peter has also given the most unequivocal testimony, to the
   inspiration of the prophets who penned the Old Testament. He had been
   speaking concerning the wonderful scene of which he was a witness, on
   the mount of transfiguration, whereupon, he goes on to say, "We have a
   more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as
   unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
   day star arise in your hearts; knowing this first, that no prophecy of
   Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not
   in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost." There is another testimony of this apostle,
   in his first epistle; in which he clearly speaks of the inspiration of
   the prophets. "Of which salvation the prophets have inquired, and
   searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
   you; searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which
   was in them did signify, when it certified beforehand the sufferings of
   Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed,
   that not unto themselves but unto us, they did minister the things
   which are now reported unto you, by them that have preached the Gospel
   unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven."

   That the Scriptures of the Old Testament were continually recognized
   by4he apostles, as given by inspiration of God, is so evident from
   every mention of them, that it may seem to be a waste of time, to
   adduce the testimonies; but the subject is exceedingly important, and
   we cannot too frequently have these evidences set before our eyes.

   In the epistle to the Hebrews, there are many clear testimonies, some
   of which I will bring forward. In the very first sentence, it is said,
   "God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past
   unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days, spoken unto
   us by his Son." Whatever is spoken by the prophets is represented
   throughout this book, as spoken by God himself. Thus, in the same
   chapter, it is declared, "And when he bringeth the first begotten into
   the world, HE saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. And to
   the angels, HE saith, who maketh his angels spirits--but to the Son, HE
   saith, thy throne O God is for ever and ever." Now, all these passages,
   where God is said to speak, are quotations from the Psalms. Certainly
   then, we may conclude, that whatever is spoken in this book of Psalms,
   is from the inspiration of God. The same is the fact, in the next
   chapter, where a large part of the eighth Psalm is quoted, and applied
   to Christ. So, also, the Captain of our Salvation is represented as
   saying certain things, which are found written in the Old Testament.
   "Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren"--"And again, I will
   put my trust in him." And in the third chapter of this epistle, we have
   a quotation from the Psalms in the following remarkable words,
   "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, To-day if ye will hear his voice,
   harden not your hearts." And in the fourth chapter, the same style is
   used as before." For HE spake in a certain place of the seventh day, in
   this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works." And in
   the fifth. "But HE said unto him, thou art my Son, to day have I
   begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, thou art a priest,
   forever after the order of Melchisedek." And God is represented as the
   speaker; not only in what is written in the Psalms, but in the prophets
   also. Thus, in the eighth chapter, we have a long quotation from
   Jeremiah, which is declared to be, the word of the Lord. "Behold the
   days come saith the Lord," &c. One more testimony from this book shall
   suffice. In the tenth chapter, it is said, "Wherefore the Holy Ghost
   also is a witness unto us; for after that he had said before, this is
   the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the
   Lord."

   Nothing can be more evident then, than that as the writers of the Old
   Testament declared themselves to speak what they received from the
   Lord, so the whole of the Scriptures are continually referred to, and
   recognized, as given by inspiration; insomuch, that it would he
   difficult to find a single passage, in which these Scriptures are
   mentioned, in which this idea is not expressed, or clearly implied. And
   it will be shown, hereafter, that the writers of the New Testament
   claim inspiration for themselves.

   lf, as has been shown, the Old Testament was written by inspiration,
   and if the New Testament contains a revelation from God, not less
   important; and which, in fact, is the completion of the Old, can we
   believe, that. while prophets were inspired to write the former, the
   latter was left to be marred and obscured, by the weaknesses of
   uninspired men?

   To accomplish the purpose intended by revelation, it seems necessary,
   that the writers who communicate it to posterity, should be guided by
   inspiration. The end of revelation is, to convey to men, a certain
   knowledge of truth, to guide their faith and practice. But if the book
   which contains such a revelation, is composed by erring, fallible men,
   we never can be sure, in any particular case, that we are in possession
   of the truth revealed. The men may be honest and faithful, but we know
   that all men are liable to errors and mistakes; and all men are more or
   less under the influence of prejudices and prepossessions. It is
   evident, therefore, that the purpose of giving a revelation, would be,
   in a great measure defeated, unless inspired men were employed to make
   the record by which it is to be transmitted to the various nations of
   the earth, and to posterity.

   Again, when we carefully consider the subject matter of the books of
   the New Testament, we cannot repose implicit confidence in what is
   taught, unless we have evidence that the pens of the writers were under
   the guidance of inspiration. To record the discourses which a man
   hears, and transactions which he sees, seems, at first sight, to
   require nothing more than veracity and integrity, in the historian.
   This might, to a certain extent, be admitted, if the witness instantly
   noted down what he heard, or saw; but who can believe, that after the
   lapse of eight, fifteen, or fifty years, the evangelists would be able
   to record, with perfect accuracy, long discourses of their Master; and,
   to relate correctly, all the circumstances of the miracles, of which
   they have given an account? It may be said, indeed, that they could
   give, substantially, the facts of which they were witnesses; but this
   is far from being satisfactory. Such a record would lose a portion of
   that reverence which it ought to receive, to give it a commanding
   authority over the conscience, and to be a solid foundation for
   unshaken confidence, And in regard to mysterious and sublime doctrines,
   which the apostles teach in their epistles, if once we admit the idea,
   that they were fallible men, we shall continually be liable to
   doubt;--we shall be afraid that they have misapprehended, or forgotten,
   what they had heard: or, that under the bias of prejudice or
   inclination, they may have been led, insensibly, to give a distorted
   view of the truths which they inculcate.

   But we are not left to conclude, from the necessity of the case merely,
   that the writers of the New Testament were inspired, by the Holy Ghost.
   We have clear and abundant proof, that our blessed Lord promised
   infallible guidance to his disciples, whom he chose to be his witnesses
   to the world; and to whom he committed the propagation of his religion,
   through all nations, and all ages, "And I will pray the father, and he
   shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever:
   even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it
   seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth
   with you, and shall be in you." And that the Holy Spirit here promised,
   was to guide the apostles in delivering their testimony, may be
   inferred from what is said in the xv. chapter. "But when the COMFORTER
   is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of
   truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me. And ye
   shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning."
   The promise of plenary inspiration is, however, more explicitly given,
   in the xvi. chapter of John. "Howbeit, when he the Spirit of truth is
   come, HE WILL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH; for he shall not speak of
   himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will
   show you things to come. He shall glorify me; for be shall receive of
   mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the father hath are
   mine; therefore, said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it
   unto you." Christ also promised the inspiration of immediate suggestion
   to his disciples, when called to answer before kings and rulers, and
   commanded them not to premeditate what they should say, for it would be
   given to them at the moment what they ought to say, "For," said he, "It
   is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost who speaketh in you." Now we
   may argue, with irresistible force, if plenary inspiration was granted
   to the apostles to enable diem to make a proper defence, when arraigned
   at a human tribunal, surely they would not be abandoned to their own
   weakness, when preparing a record of Christ's words and actions, which
   was, through all ages, to be the guide of his church? If the apostles
   were ever inspired, we may be sure that it was, when directed to finish
   and record the testimony of God. The very idea, that every book of the
   Old Testament was given by inspiration, but that the whole of the New
   was composed without this aid, is revolting to the reason of man. And
   this will appear the more unreasonable, when we consider, that the
   light of the new dispensation is seven-fold clearer than that of the
   Old. The very forerunner of Christ, was superior to all the prophets
   that preceded him: but the least in the kingdom of heaven was greater
   than he. Then, certainly, if all the prophets only spoke as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost, the apostles, who were the chosen witnesses of
   Christ, and chief officers of his kingdom, were not left without this
   infallible guidance, when engaged in performing the most important part
   of the responsible duty assigned them; when executing that part of
   their commission, which was most effectual in extending and
   perpetuating his spiritual kingdom? Accordingly, the apostles claim to
   be inspired men; and speak with an authority which would be arrogant,
   if they had not written under an infallible guidance. They do not
   merely express their own private opinions, and endeavor to support them
   by argument; but they speak as men assured of the truth of what they
   deliver; and decide with authority and without hesitation, questions,
   which none but men inspired by the Holy Spirit could undertake thus
   positively to determine, without, exposing themselves to the charge of
   dogmatism and self-sufficiency.

   Besides, some parts of the New Testament--like much of the old--are
   prophetic; and if true, could be written in no other way, than by
   inspiration. The Apocalypse, or Revelation given to John, is either a
   mere enthusiastic fable, or, it was written by inspiration; and such is
   the majesty of the ideas here presented, and the awful sublimity of the
   style, that even Dr. Priestly, was constrained to acknowledge, that it
   bore on its face, marks of a superhuman origin. And if we bad time to
   compare the prophetic representations .of this singular book with
   authentic history, there would arise an evidence of its inspiration,
   which could not be easily contradicted. Such men as, Sir Isaac Newton,
   Dr. Clarke, bishop Hurd, bishop Newton, and a multitude of others, have
   seen in this book, the most convincing .proof of divine inspiration.
   The same may be said of all the prophecies of the Old and New
   Testament. if there is any truth, whatever, in them, they must be
   inspired; for, none but inspired men can foretell future, contingent
   events. Indeed, in all the cases, where Moses and others declare, that
   God spoke to them, and communicated instructions, or laws, they must be
   considered as divinely directed, unless we deny their veracity. But we
   are now reasoning on the hypothesis, that the books are authentic, and
   written by men of truth and honesty.

   The style of the evangelists has often been adduced as an evidence of
   their inspiration. Not that they write with an elegance and sublimity
   which cannot be imitated; but because they write as persons divested of
   the feelings which commonly belong to men. They write with an
   unaffected simplicity, and with an impartial, dispassionate regard to
   truth, that has no parallel, and has never been successfully initiated.
   How could illiterate men produce such works as the Gospels, without
   inspiration? Select a thousand sensible men, but unaccustomed to
   composition, and set them to write a simple history of the most
   remarkable transactions with which they have been conversant, and there
   will not be in any one of them, an approximation to the characteristic
   manner of the evangelists. Others, and men possessed of more learning
   than the apostles, have undertaken, without inspiration, to write
   Gospels, as if composed by some one or other of these holy men; but you
   cannot place the evidence of the inspiration of the genuine Gospels, in
   a stronger light, than by contrasting them with any, or all the
   apocryphal writings, under the names of the apostles.

   But we are in danger here of repeating what has already been said,
   under the head of the Internal Evidences of Christianity. The truth is,
   that the whole of the arguments from this source, for divine
   revelation, are directly in point, to prove the doctrine of
   inspiration; and, therefore, instead of going over the ground a second
   time, I would refer to what has been said, in the preceding chapter.

   Miracles, also, furnish the most conclusive proof of inspiration, where
   it can be ascertained, that the writer of any book of Scripture
   possessed the power of performing such works; for, the very end for
   which miracles were exhibited, was to prove that the person speaking
   was sent from God, to deliver some message. As Nicodemus properly said,
   "We know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do the
   miracles which thou doest, unless God be with him." Well, if miracles
   are sufficient to prove the truth of an oral communication, will they
   not also be equally conclusive, in favor of a written declaration? If
   there be any difference, it is in favor of the latter, because it is
   much more important, that a written discourse, intended for the
   instruction of all ages, should be well attested, than a discourse from
   the lips, which is heard by few, and can never be recovered after it
   has been spoken.

   In the whole of what has been said on the subject of inspiration, the
   truth of the facts recorded in the New Testament has been taken for
   granted; and, also, that the Scriptures contain a divine revelation. We
   are not arguing with infidels, but with those, who, while they
   acknowledge the divine origin of the Christian religion, doubt, or
   deny, that the persons who wrote the books of the Old and New
   Testament, were guided by a plenary inspiration. Now, as these persons
   admit that the apostles and evangelists were men of veracity and
   integrity, their testimony, on this subject, ought to be decisive. If
   they claim inspiration, we cannot deny it to them, without invalidating
   all the strongest evidences of the truth of Christianity. Why were they
   endowed with the power of working miracles, but that full credence
   might be given to what they testified; and when they declare, that they
   were moved by the Holy Ghost; and that what they delivered, was not the
   word of men but the word of God, received by divine revelation, do not
   these miraculous powers which they possessed, as fully confirm what
   they wrote, as what they spoke?

   Having before shown, that the apostles furnish ample testimony to the
   inspiration of the Old Testament, we shall now adduce a few texts to
   prove, that they claimed inspiration for themselves. Their message is
   every where called THE WORD OF GOD; and Paul declares, that what he
   preached, he received not from man, but "from the revelation of Jesus
   Christ." that the things which he wrote, were "The commandments of the
   Lord;" and that the things which he and his brethren taught, "God had
   revealed them to them by his Spirit." He, therefore, declared, "He who
   despiseth the things which he taught, despised not men but God." Peter
   ranks "the commandments delivered by the apostles, with the words of
   the Holy Prophets; and as has been before remarked, reckons the
   epistles of Paul, with the other Scriptures." John says, "We are of
   God; he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not
   us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."

   The only thing wanting to complete the evidence of the inspiration of
   the New Testament, and consequently that of the Old, is to show, that
   these writings were received unanimously by the Christian Church, as
   inspired writings. But although, there exists abundant evidence of this
   fact, yet to pursue it would lead., us too much into detail, and would
   not comport with the studied brevity of this work. And I am the less
   inclined to enter on the labor of collecting this testimony, here,
   because I have attempted this in another work. I may say, however, that
   in the early ages of the Church, no Christian ever called in question
   the inspiration of the sacred volume; but all held this as a
   fundamental point, in their religion. It was left for those, who chose
   to style themselves rationalists, in modern times, to admit the
   authenticity of the facts recorded in the Bible; while they utterly
   deny the plenary inspiration of the writers. But this is ground on
   which no consistent reasoner can long stand. The truth is, if the
   miracles and prophecies of the Scriptures be acknowledged, and the
   divine origin of Christianity be admitted, the inspiration of the
   penmen of these books must follow as a corollary. It cannot be denied
   without the greatest inconsistency. And, on the other hand, if
   inspiration be denied, the authenticity of the miracles and prophecies
   will soon Le abandoned. The course of theological opinion among the
   neologists of Germany, for a number of years past, furnishes a striking
   illustration of the truth of the aforesaid observations. For a while,
   the assault, in that country, was merely upon the doctrine of
   inspiration; but no sooner was that ground conceded, than the critics
   directed their artillery against the authenticity of the miraculous
   facts and prophecies.

   There is no end to the objections which may be started against the
   plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, just as is the fact in regard to
   the visible universe, as. the work of God; and it cannot be denied,
   that there is a striking analogy between the mode of reasoning pursued
   by atheists and deists. But the foundation of all their arguments is
   human ignorance and they cannot, form the conception of a creation, by
   a Being of almighty power and infinite wisdom, and of a supernatural
   revelation from such a being, which would not be liable. to as great,
   and much greater objections, than they are able to bring forward
   against his works and word, as they do actually exist. If such men
   could be induced,. in a calm and unprejudiced manner, to examine this
   subject, I would recommend to them a careful perusal of Butler's
   Analogy, between Natural and Revealed Religion; and to the deist, I
   would especially recommend the seventh chapter, of the second Part,
   where. the author, in a manner peculiar to himself, makes first, some
   observations ON THE PARTICULAR EVIDENCES OF CHRISTIANITY, and then, in
   the close, exhibits a view of the evidence arising from a general
   survey of the contents of the Bible. The argument, as presented in this
   last form, is so original and striking, that I would insert it in this
   place, were I not afraid of swelling this volume to an inconvenient
   size. The whole of the second book of the Analogy may be considered as
   the most satisfactory method of meeting the popular objections to
   divine revelation, which was ever adopted.

   And in regard to particular objections, arising from apparent
   discrepancies, from extraordinary facts, and from mysterious doctrines,
   found in the sacred volume, it will be sufficient to refer the
   inquisitive reader, to the first volume of Horne's Introduction, and to
   Dr. Dick's deservedly popular work, on Inspiration; and also, to
   learned commentators, some of whom have taken much pains to reconcile
   seeming contradictions, and to elucidate obscure passages, by an
   application of the rules of sacred criticism. I would only further
   remark, in relation to the usual objections to the inspiration of the
   Scriptures, that they militate as fully against the authenticity of the
   facts, as against, the inspiration of the writers; and, therefore, do
   not require to be considered and obviated under this head.

   A summary of the whole evidence for the plenary inspiration of the
   Scriptures, of the Old and New Testament, is as follows:--All the
   Internal Evidences of Christianity, whether arising from the peculiar
   excellence of the matter, or the simplicity and sublimity of the
   style--from the perfection of the character ascribed to Jesus
   Christ--from the continual recognition of the over-ruling Providence of
   God--from the pure and elevated spirit of devotion which breathes
   through the sacred pages--from the penetrating and transforming
   efficacy of the Holy Scriptures--and from, their adaptation to the
   constitution of the human mind,. and to the existing relations among
   men;--go to prove, that they were written under the infallible guidance
   of the Holy Spirit.

   Again, every prophecy which has been fulfilled, furnishes undoubted and
   independent evidence of the inspiration of that particular part of the
   Scriptures; and all the laws which proceeded from the mouth of Jehovah,
   must be considered as infallible precepts, unless we should call in
   question the whole truth of the narrative.

   The writers, for the most part, were endued with the power of working
   miracles. These facts, it is admitted, prove that God spake by them;
   and if the: prophets and apostles were inspired in the discourses,
   which they delivered, then a fortiori, they must have been inspired in
   preparing those writings which were intended to guide the faith and
   practice of believers, through all ages.

   Moreover, the sacred writers, generally lay claim to inspiration. They
   speak authoritatively in the name of the Lord. They call their message,
   the WORD OF GOD and Christ has set his seal to the plenary inspiration
   of all the Scriptures of the Old Testament. The apostles and
   evangelists, in the most explicit manner; declare the same truth.

   Besides, Christ promised plenary inspiration to his disciples; and they
   professed to be under the guidance of the Spirit, in what they wrote.

   And, finally, while some of the apostles were living, their writings
   were classed with the divine Scriptures; and were universally received
   as inspired, and as the infallible word of God, by the whole primitive
   Church.

   We cannot but conclude, therefore, that all the books of the Old and
   New Testament, were written by the inspiration of God; and contain an
   infallible rule, to guide the faith and practice of the church, to the
   end of the world.

AN APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI.

   On the Proof of Miracles by Testimony.

   IN a recent popular, but anonymous publication, entitled, Essays on the
   Pursuit of Truth, on the Progress of Knowledge, and the Fundamental
   Principles of all Evidence and Expectation, By the Author of Essays on
   the Formation and Publication of Opinions," the doctrine of ne, on the
   subject of testimony, has been exhibited in a ...a somewhat new and
   imposing, And as this writer has ired considerable celebrity in
   England, and his Essays have been republished in Philadelphia, and
   recommended strongly to the public, upon the authority of the
   Westminster Review, it seems necessary to guard the public against the
   insidious design of these Essays; which we have reason to think, was
   not known to those concerned in the republication of the work in this
   country. Indeed, the ingenious author, never brings the subject of
   divine revelation directly into view, in all that he has written; and I
   believe, the word "miracles" does not occur in either of the volumes
   which he has published nevertheless, it is a fact, that in the last of
   his essays, he has revived, in substance, the famous argument of Hume,
   on miracles; and has, with even more concealed istry; than that
   celebrated infidel employed, endeavored to e that no testimony, however
   strong, is sufficient to establish fact which involves a deviation from
   the regular course of the laws of Nature. But that I may not be
   suspected of misrepresenting the sentiments of this discriminating and
   popular writer, I will here insert an extract, from the Essay
   before-mentioned, which contains the substance of the whole argument.

   "But it is only a small part of our knowledge of past events which we
   gather from physical evidence. By far the most important source of
   information of such events is the testimony of human beings; and it is
   a curious, interesting, and momentous inquiry, whether we proceed on
   the same principle when we avail ourselves of this moral evidence to
   penetrate into the past, as when we make use of that which is of a
   purely physical character.

   "Testimony must be either oral or written. As far as the mere physical
   circumstances are concerned, we evidently commence our use of it by
   reasoning from effects to causes. We infer, for example, that the
   writing before us has been the work of some human being, in doing which
   we of course assume the uniformity of causation. If from the
   circumstances attending the testimony we infer that is entitled to be
   received as veracious; if for instance, we find that it has proceeded
   from a man of tried integrity, and who acted under the influence of
   motives which render it unlikely that he should deceive, our inference
   still proceeds on the assumption of the same principle. I may have in
   other cases found these circumstances to have been the precursors or
   causes of true testimony; but how can I or any one tell that they have
   operated in the same way in the instance before me? The reply must
   evidently I be, that it is impossible to avoid assuming that the same
   causes have invariably the same effects.

   "In fact, if we examine any of the rules which have been laid down for
   the reception of testimony, or any of those marks which have been
   pointed out as enabling us to judge of its credibility, we shall find
   them all involving the uniformity of causation. It is allowed on all
   hands, that the concurrence of a number of witnesses in the same
   assertion, their reputation for veracity, the fact of the testimony
   being against their own interest, the probability of detection in any
   false statements, are all circumstances enhancing the credibility of
   what they affirm. These are considered as general principles on the
   subject gathered from experience, and we apply them instinctively to
   any new case which may be presented to us, either in the course of our
   own observation, or as having taken place at some former period. But it
   is obvious from what has just been said, that unless we assume a
   uniformity in the succession of causes and effects, we cannot transfer
   our experience from any one case to another. That certain circumstances
   have produced true testimony in one or a hundred instances, can be no
   reason why they should produce it in a different instance, unless we
   assume that the same causes have necessarily the same effects.

   "It is clearly shown by this reasoning, that in the reception of
   testimony and the use of physical evidence we proceed on the same
   principle. But in the case of testimony there is a peculiarity not
   belonging to physical evidence. In the former we not only have certain
   effects from which it is our task to infer the causes, or certain
   causes from which to infer the effects; as when we judge the writing
   before us to have been the work of some human being, or the testimony
   to be true on account of the circumstances under which it was given;
   but the testimony itself consists of the assertion of facts, and the
   nature of the facts asserted often forms part of the grounds on which
   the veracity of the testimony is determined; it frequently happens,
   that while external circumstances tend to confirm the testimony, the
   nature and circumstances of the facts attested render it highly
   improbable that any such facts should have taken place, and these two
   sets of circumstances -may be so exactly equivalent as to leave the
   mind in irremediable doubt. In the consideration of both, however, the
   same assumption is involved. We think the facts improbable, because we
   have found them rarely occurring under the circumstances stated; we
   think the testimony likely to be true, because we have generally found
   true testimony to proceed from witnesses acting under the influence of
   similar motives, and what we have found to happen in other cases we are
   irresistibly led to conclude must also happen in the case before us.

   "The opposition of the circumstances of the evidence and the nature of
   the facts may be carried still further. Assertions are frequently made
   which in themselves imply a breach of the uniformity of causation. From
   such cases the conclusions already established remove all difficulty.
   To weigh probabilities, to determine what credit is due to two sets of
   conflicting circumstances, neither of which as far as our knowledge
   extends is irreconcilable to the usual course of nature, is often a
   nice and arduous task; but if the principles of this essay are correct,
   it is easy to see what reception ought to be given to assertions
   professedly implying a deviation from the uniform succession of causes
   and effects.

   "Suppose, for instance, any person to affirm that he had exposed a
   cubic inch of ice to a temperature of 200 degrees of Fahrenheit, and
   that at the expiration of an hour it had retained its solidity. Here is
   a sequence of events asserted which is entirely at variance with the
   admitted course of nature; and the slightest reflection is sufficient
   to show that to believe the assertion would involve a logical
   absurdity. The intrinsic discrepancy of the facts could never be
   overcome by any possible proofs of the truth of the testimony.

   "For let us put the strongest case imaginable; let us suppose that the
   circumstance of the ice remaining unmelted, rests on the concurrent
   testimony of a great number of people, people too of reputation,
   science, and perspacity, who had no motive for falsehood, who had
   discernment to perceive and honesty to tell the real truth, and whose
   interests would essentially suffer from any departure from veracity.
   Under such circumstances false testimony it may be alleged is
   impossible.

   "Now mark the principle on which this representation proceeds. Let us
   concede the positions, that what is attested by a great number of
   witnesses must inevitably be true,--that people of reputation and
   intelligence without any apparent motive for falsehood are invariably
   accurate in their testimony, and that they are above all, incapable of
   violating truth, when a want of veracity would be ruinous to their
   interests. Granting all this, I ask the objector, how he knows that
   these things are so; that men of this character and in these
   circumstances speak truth? He will reply that he has invariably found
   them to act in this manner: but why, because you found them to act in
   this manner in a few or even in many cases, within your own experience
   or in the experience of ages, do you conclude that they have acted so
   in all cases and in the case before us? The only answer is, that it is
   impossible not to take for granted, that in precisely similar
   circumstances similar results will ensue, or that like causes have
   always like effects.

   "Thus on the ground of the uniformity of causation, he would be
   maintaining the competency of testimony to prove a fact which implies a
   deviation from that uniformity."

   Now it will abbreviate the answer to this specious argument, to
   acknowledge, that the general principle which this author takes so much
   pains to establish, and on which he builds his reasoning, is freely
   admitted, to be not only correct, but self-evident. That the same
   causes uniformly produce the same effects, is a truth so obvious, and
   so generally admitted, that it. was unnecessary for the ingenious
   author of this essay, to spend so much time in rendering it evident.
   And I am willing to admit its certainty to be as undoubted in moral, as
   in physical subjects. But while I freely admit, that the same causes
   will uniformly be followed by the same effects, I do by no means accede
   to the proposition, which our author seems to consider as of the same
   import; namely, that the course of nature, or the laws of nature, never
   have been interrupted, or suspended; and the whole appearance of force
   and plausibility which the argument of this writer possesses, arises
   from the artful confounding of these distinct propositions. I agree,
   that no testimony can be strong enough to induce a rational man to
   believe that the same causes will not be attended with the same
   effects: for this would be to assent to an evident absurdity. But it is
   an entirely different thing to believe, that the laws of nature have
   sometimes been suspended; for in this case, we suppose, that an
   extraordinary cause has intervened. To believe, that a divine power has
   interposed to change the course of nature, is surely not the same
   thing, as to believe that the same cause which commonly produced one
   effect, is now attended by another entirely different. The natural
   causes, it is true, remain the same, but the general proposition slated
   above, is not true, if confined only to these. If there exist
   supernatural causes, or a power superior to the laws of nature,--and
   this our author does not profess to deny--then the laws of nature, or
   mere natural causes may remain the same; and yet, by the operation of
   these supernatural causes, effects entirely diverse from those that
   would be the sequence of natural causes, may take place, And the author
   himself seems in one place to, have been aware of this distinction, and
   to admonish the reader of its existence; and yet, through the whole of
   the argument he proceeds, as if the two propositions were identical.
   fie ought, however, to have recollected, that while no man in his
   senses disbelieves the first proposition, much the greater number of
   men have believed, that in some cases the laws of nature have been
   suspended; not, that they thought that the same causes did not, in
   these instances, produce the same effects, but that other causes of
   greater potency than natural causes, were put into operation.

   When our author, therefore, infers from the uniformity of causation,
   that no testimony is sufficient to be the foundation of a rational
   belief, that there has been a deviation from the common course of
   nature, be applies a correct principle to a case to which it evidently
   does not belong. Because, the same cause must produce the same effects,
   does it follow, that when another and superior cause operates, the same
   effects must be produced? This would be in direct repugnance to his own
   maxim. Then, before this principle of the uniformity of causes and
   effects can he applied, it must be demonstrated, that in the case under
   consideration, no other causes operate, but such as are usual and
   natural, and whenever he shall be able to establish this, there will be
   no further contest respecting the matter.

   That I do not misrepresent the argument of the author, wilt appear
   satisfactorily, by considering the cases which be has adduced.
   "Suppose, for instance," says he, "any person to affirm, that he had
   exposed a cubic Inch of ice to a temperature of 200 degrees of
   Fahrenheit, and that at the expiration of an hour, it had retained its
   solidity. Here is a sequence of events asserted, which is entirely at
   variance with the admitted course of nature; and the slightest
   reflection is sufficient to show, that to believe the assertion, would
   involve a logical absurdity, The intrinsic discrepancy of the facts
   could never be overcome by any possible proofs of the truth of
   testimony."

   In another page, he says, "If a number of Men were to swear, that they
   had seen the mercury of the barometer remain at the height of thirty
   inches, when placed in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, their
   testimony would be instantly rejected. The universal conclusion would
   be, that such an event was impossible." What is here so confidently
   asserted, would only be true upon the supposition, that no causes but
   such as were natural operated in the cases adduced; but on the
   hypothesis of the operation of a supernatural cause, there would be
   neither absurdity nor impossibility in either of the facts. What! could
   not He, who established these laws, and gave to heat and air,
   respectively, their peculiar powers and qualities, suspend their usual
   operation? Could not He, clause the ice to remain unmelted in any
   temperature; and the mercury to remain suspended, without the pressure
   of the atmosphere? But the sophistical nature of the argument used, is
   most evident. The principle is, that similar causes must have similar
   effects. Very good--what then? Why, if ice remain unmelted at 200
   degrees of Fahrenheit, then this principle would be violated. I answer,
   not at all, provided another cause is in operation, of such potency as
   to counteract the usual effects of caloric; or to counteract the
   gravity of the quicksilver, in vacuo. And it will not do to allege,
   that God, who established these laws, will not contravene them, on any
   occasion; for this would be an entire change of the ground of the
   argument, and a relinquishment of the principle on which the reasoning
   of our author is founded. Besides, it would be a mere begging the
   question in dispute.

   Now, in both the cases adduced by this writer, to illustrate and
   confirm his argument, on which he pronounces so confidently, that the
   judgment of men would universally reject any testimony, I beg leave to
   be of a different opinion, and will appeal to the common sense of all
   reflecting men, whether, on the supposition, that a dozen men of
   perspicacity and undoubted integrity, should solemnly affirm that they
   had seen a cubic inch of ice remain an hour unmelted at 200 degrees of
   Fahrenheit, whether they could refuse their assent? even if they knew
   of no good reason why the laws of nature should be suspended. But if
   they knew that an important purpose in the divine government could be
   answered by such a miracle, much less testimony would be sufficient to
   produce unwavering conviction of the truth of the extraordinary fact.
   And while they assent to such facts, on sufficient testimony; they are
   guilty of no absurdity, and violate no rule of common sense. It is
   true, that the credibility of the event reported, may be reduced to
   this question--whether is it more probable, that the laws of nature
   should, for a good end, be suspended, or that twelve men of tried
   veracity, should agree to assert a falsehood, without any motive to
   induce them to do so? And here our ingenious author revives the
   metaphysical balance or Mr. Hume; and after admitting that the evidence
   from testimony may be so strong that nothing is wanting to give it
   force, yet the maxim, that the same causes must have the same effects,
   is also a truth so certain, that no evidence can countervail it. We
   have, therefore, according to this statement, the equipoise of
   evidence, which we have already considered, in Mr. Hume's argument. The
   rational mina, in such circumstance, must remain neutral; it can
   neither believe nor disbelieve; for the evidence for the one exactly
   counterbalances that for the other. But after stating this hypothesis,
   our author finds that the evidence from testimony never can be so
   convincing, as that which we have for the uniformity of causation. His
   words are--"If the rejection and the admission of the testimony equally
   implied a deviation from the uniform sequence of causes and effects,
   there could be no reason for rejecting or admitting it."--"But the
   rejection of the testimony is not in this predicament. The causes of
   testimony, or in other words, those considerations which operate on the
   minds of the witness, cannot always be ascertained; and as we are
   uncertain as to the causes in operation, we cannot be certain of the
   effects, we cannot be sure that the circumstances of the witness are
   such as have given rise to true testimony, and consequently we cannot
   be sure that the testimony is true."

   On this whole subject I have several remarks to make.--First, this
   method of destroying the equipoise of evidence granted by Mr. Hume, and
   conceded by himself, is not altogether fair; because it does not adroit
   what Is obviously true, that in regard to some kinds of testimony, the
   evidence is so certain, that we might as soon doubt of our own
   existence as of the truth of the facts attested. Now, this being the
   case, there was no propriety in representing all testimony as being
   involved in some degree of uncertainty.

   Again, what is here said of testimony will apply just as fully to what
   we ourselves witness, and for the truth of which we have the testimony
   of our own senses. I mean, that if the argument of our author is at all
   valid, it will prove, that if we saw the ice remain unmelted in the
   heat, and beheld it ever so often; and found that thousands around us
   received the same impression, we must not credit our own senses, nor
   believe what we saw with our own eyes; because, however certain this
   kind of, evidence may be, it cannot be more certain, than the
   principle, that the same causes will uniformly produce the same
   effects. Therefore, although we should, under all manner of
   circumstances, see such events, they could not be believed; for to
   believe them would be a logical absurdity. And thus, would these men,
   by their metaphysics, reason us out of the evidence of our very
   eye-sight. I know, indeed, that neither Hume, nor the author whose
   reasoning, we are now considering, have pushed the argument to this its
   just consequence; but I would defy any man to show, that it is not as
   applicable to the evidence of the senses as to that derived from
   testimony. Now, as the kind of evidence which will invariably command
   assent, is not learned by metaphysical reasoning, but by experience, I
   would leave the matter to be decided by every man of impartial
   judgment, for himself. Every man knows, whether or not, he would
   believe his own eyes, if lie should see ice remain unmelted in 200
   degrees of temperature, according to Fahrenheit: or would be say, it
   seems to be so, but it cannot be true, because it contradicts a
   self-evident principle, "that the same causes must always be followed
   by the same effects." To which a man of plain, unsophisticated common
   sense would reply, "I must believe my own senses; if doing so
   contradicts a thousand abstract principles, I care not--seeing is
   believing.'" And the same may be said in regard to testimony. Suppose a
   thousand persons entirely disinterested to aver, that they had seen ice
   remain unmelted in a very high temperature, we could not but believe
   them, account for the fact as we might. But we have already proved,
   that believing in such an event violates no maxim, but only supposes
   that some extraordinary power or cause is in operation; and when it is
   understood, that this deviation from the laws of nature is intended to
   confirm the declarations of some person who claims to be a messenger of
   God, there is not only no absurdity in the thing; but all presumption
   against the probability of such supernatural interposition is removed,
   as has been shown in the argument on that subject.

   It might also be demonstrated, that upon the principles of this author,
   not only would it be absurd, upon any evidence, to believe in a fact
   which involved a real deviation from the laws of nature, but in any one
   which was entirely different from all our own experience of the laws of
   nature. For if it would be absurd to believe, on the testimony of
   thousands of unconnected witnesses that ice did not melt in a certain
   case when placed in the fire; then it was altogether rational for the
   king of Siam, and all others in similar circumstances, to disbelieve
   the fact, that water had been known to become as hard as a stone so
   that men and animals could walk upon it. Persons so situated never
   could know that. such an effect existed but by testimony; yet as this
   testimony contradicted all their own experience about the laws of
   nature, in relation to water, they ought rather to reject the
   testimony, however strong, than to credit a fact which seemed to
   involve a deviation from "the sequence of causes and effects," to use
   the language f this author. And thus we should be reduced to the
   necessity of rejecting all facts not consonant to our own personal
   experience; for to receive them on the ground of testimony, would be to
   violate the principle, that causation is uniform.

   But the zeal of our author to establish his favorite point, has led
   him, not only to assert, that a deviation from the regular succession
   of the laws of nature was incredible, on the ground of testimony, but
   that it is, in the nature of things. impossible. In this assertion, he
   certainly may lay claim to originality; for I believe no one before
   him, not even Hume, has gone so far, in bold affirmation. His words
   are--"An event is impossible which contradicts our experience, or which
   implies that the same causes have produced different effects, or the
   same effects been preceded by different causes. Thus, when we pronounce
   that it was impossible for a piece of ice to remain in the midst of
   burning coals without being dissolved,. our conclusion involves a
   complete knowledge of this particular effect of fire on ice."

   And he is so confident that this is the true import of the word
   impossible, that he says, "If I am not greatly deceived, the acutest
   reasoner, the closest thinker, the most subtle analyser of words, will
   find himself unable to produce any other meaning of the term,
   impossible, than that which is here assigned to it." But he seems to
   have felt that he had gone too far in this dogmatical, and I must say,
   irrational assertion; for in a note he gives himself, another, and one
   of the true meanings of the word, impossible. But as confident
   assertion, accompanied by no proof nor reason, is sufficiently answered
   by a confident denial, I would take the liberty of saying, therefore,
   that if I am not greatly mistaken, no accurate philologist will admit,
   that this is the true meaning of the word, impossible. And certainly,
   men of plain common sense, never can be persuaded, that it is
   impossible for the succession of events according to the laws of
   nature, to be changed. It is true, when we confine our ideas to the
   mere powers and qualities of nature, we do assert that their effects
   will be uniform, and that it is impossible that the same causes should
   produce different effects; but when we extend our views to the Great
   FIRST CAUSE, it is not only absurd, but impious, to assert, that he
   cannot suspend or alter the laws of nature. Nothing is impossible to
   him which does not imply a contradiction, or is not repugnant to his
   attributes.

   The conclusion which is rational on this subject, is, that all things
   are possible to God, and whatever is possible may be believed on
   sufficient testimony; which testimony, however, must be strong, in
   proportion to the improbability of the. event to be confirmed.

NOTE B.

   Mohammed asserted, that while he was in his bed one night, the Angel
   Gabriel knocked at his door, and that when he went out, he saw him with
   seventy pair of expanded wings, whiter than snow, and clearer than
   chrystal. The angel informed him that he had come to conduct him to
   heaven; and directed him to mount an animal, which stood ready at the
   door, and which was between the nature of an ass and a mule. They name
   of this beast was Alborak, in color whiter than milk, and swift as
   lightning. But when the prophet went to mount, the animal proved
   refractory, and he could not seat himself upon its back, until he
   promised it a place in Paradise.

   The journey from Mecca to Jerusalem was performed in the twinkling of
   an eye. When he arrived at the latter place, the departed prophets and
   saints came forth to meet him, and saluted him. Here, he found a ladder
   of light, and tying Alborak to a rock, he followed Gabriel on the
   ladder, until they arrived at the first heaven, where admittance was
   readily granted by the porter, when he was told by Gabriel, that the
   person who accompanied him, was Mohammed, the prophet of God. Here, he
   met an old decrepit man, who it seems was no other than our father
   Adam; and who greatly rejoiced at having so distinguished a son. He saw
   also innumerable angels, in the shape of birds, beasts, and men. This
   heaven was made of pure silver, and he saw the stars suspended from it,
   by chains of gold.

   In like manner, he ascended to the second heaven, a distance of five
   hundred years journey, which was of pure gold, and contained twice as
   many angels as the former. Here, he met Noah. Thence he proceeded to
   the third, which was made of precious stones, where he met Abraham. The
   fourth was all of emerald, where he met Joseph, the son of Jacob. In
   the fifth, which was of adamant, lie met Moses. In the sixth, which was
   of carbuncle, he saw John the Baptist. In the seventh which was made of
   divine light, he saw Jesus Christ, and commended himself to his
   prayers. All the persons he had seen before, however, begged an
   interest in his prayers. Here Gabriel informed him, that he could go no
   further, and he proceeded alone, through snow and water, until he came
   near the throne of God, when he heard a voice, saying, "O Mohammed,
   salute thy Creator!" He was not permitted to come near the throne of
   the Almighty, on the right side of which he saw inscribed the sentence,
   there is no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet; which is the
   fundamental article of the Mohammedan creed.

   After being permitted to bold a long conversation with the Creator, he
   returned as he came, and found Alborak ready to convey him home, on
   whose back he swiftly glided again to Mecca. All this happened in the
   space of the tenth part of a night.

   In the third heaven, he says, he saw an angel of so great a size, that
   the distance between his eyes, was of seventy thou. sand days journey.
   This was the angel of death, who has a large table before him on which
   he is ever writing and blotting out; whenever a name is blotted, the
   person immediately dies. He speaks also of another angel, in the sixth
   heaven; which had seventy thousand heads and as many tongues.

NOTE C.

   The Abbe Paris was the oldest son of a counsellor of Paris, but being
   much inclined to a life of devotion, he relinquished his patrimony to
   his younger brother, and retired to an obscure part of Paris, where he
   spent his life in severe penance, and in charitable exertions, for the
   relief of the distressed poor, He was buried in the ground of the
   church of St. Medard, near the wall, where his brother erected a
   tomb-stone over the grave. To this spot many poor people, who knew his
   manner of life, came to perform their devotions, as much, probably out
   of feelings of gratitude, as any thing else. Some among the devotees
   who attended at this place, professed that they experienced a salutary
   change in their ailments. This being noised abroad, as the Abbe had
   been a jealous Jansenist, all who were of this party encouraged the
   idea of miracles having been performed; and multitudes who were
   indisposed, were induced to go to the tomb of the saint; and some, as
   they confessed before a competent tribunal, were persuaded to feign
   diseases which they never bad. It is a fact, however, that the greater
   part received no benefit, and that more diseases were produced than
   were cured; for, soon, many of the worshippers were seized with
   convulsions, from which procceeded the sect of Convulsionists, which
   attracted attention for many years. It was soon found expedient to
   close up the tomb; but cures were still said to be performed by the
   saint, on persons in distant places. The Jesuits exerted themselves to
   discredit the whole business, and the Archbishop of Paris had a
   judicial investigation made of a number of the most remarkable cases,
   the results of which were various, and often ludicrous. A young woman,
   said to have been cured at the tomb of blindness and lameness, was
   proved to have been neither blind nor lame. A man with diseased eyes
   was relieved, but it appeared that he was then using powerful medicine,
   and that after all, his eyes were not entirely healed. A certain Abbe
   who had the misfortune to have one of his legs shorter than the other,
   was persuaded that he experienced a sensible elongation of the
   defective limb, but on measurement no increase could be discovered. A
   woman in the same situation danced on the tomb daily, to obtain an
   elongation of a defective limb, and was persuaded that she received
   benefit; but it was ascertained, that she would have to dance there
   fifty-four years, before the cure would be effected, at the rate at
   which it was proceeding; but for the unfortunate Abbe, seventy-two
   years would have, been requisite. In short, the whole number of cures,
   after examination, was reduced to eight or nine, all of which can be
   easily accounted for, on natural principles; and in several of these
   instances, the cures were not perfect.
